1366	biaxin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection	The antibiotic may have destroyed bacteria causing my sinus infection.  But it may also have been caused by a virus, so its hard to say.	Some back pain, some nauseau.	Took the antibiotics for 14 days. Sinus infection was gone after the 6th day.
3724	lamictal	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder	"Lamictal stabilized my serious mood swings. One minute I was clawing up the walls in pure mania, the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicdie. I am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. I'm lucky that I started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after I was diagnosed a bipolar. Lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day, honestly assess myself and form real relationships. Lamitcal lifted a fog, I guess you could call it. Now that I'm medicated I realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. It's a wonderful feeling.

Interestingly, I hardly dreamt before beginning Lamictal. I would dream (I mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep, not REM) maybe once every two months. Now I dream every night. I found that the closer I take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams."	"Drowsiness, a bit of mental numbness. If you take too much, you will feel sedated. Since you have to be able to clearly and honestly assess your emotions and thoughts, determining how much medication you need is tough. I found that 400mg works perfectly for me, but that's a high dose. Less than that and I can feel the medicine wearing off prematurely (I like it to last 24hrs, from sleep to sleep). More than that and I feel numb. Some might call it drowsiness, but it's more a sluggishness of the mind for me.

Before I began treating my bipolar disorder, I used to write a fair amount of fiction. It sort of flowed from me. I definitely had the artist's temperament. After Lamictal, though, that inherent creativity fizzled out. It doesn't come spilling out of me while I'm deep into a manic euphoria. I have to work at art now. It's something that requires discipline. If you are in a field which requires creativity, expect to see a change in your output."	"""My experience with this medicine is positive especially since my recent dose increase. Before, getting up in the morning was hard."""
3824	depakene	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Initial benefits were comparable to the brand name version of this drug, Depakote.  I had been taking Depakote for several months and experienced great results.  When I went to my psychiatrist for an evaluation and re-fill, he accidently prescribed the generic version, Depakene.  When I discovered the error, I was told by this doctor that I would experience the same results as Depakote.  The positive side effects of the Depakene: balanced mood, improved concentration, improved logical cognition, mental clarity, lessened anxiety and irritability, improved sleep, increase in pleasure about activities	Depakene has a very thin coating, which caused severe heart burn and stomach upset.  The discomfort was so unpleasant that it made me not want to take my meds, so I was not taking them consistently as prescribed.  This caused my mood to fluctuate again.  Even after I switched to the Depakote, my stomach was still uncomfortable for several weeks afterwards.  My appetite decreased and food was very unappetizing.  Certain foods that I normally enjoy, such as chicken or fish, made me feel extremely queasy when I ate them.  I did not like the physical side effect of the drug, and decided to quit my psychiatric drugs altogether - because I was no longer stable anymore!	"""I was on this for 4 1/2 years, right up to a very high dose.  I got the side effect of constantly feeling hungry yet never feeling full, no matter how much I ate.  That immediately caused me to gain 10 lbs. a month for 6 months:  60 pounds!  It also gave me the side effects of major depression and a generally unpleasant mood overall.  

It was of the usual average effectiveness in controlling my seizures, which began due to neurological brain damage in a traffic accident.

696	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nodular acne	Within one week of treatment superficial acne lesions were visibly reduced.  Sebum production which had been excessive before beginning was significantly reduced (after course of treatment level increased to a more normal level).  After one month of treatment no new acne lesions occured.  By the end of treatment no new acne developed, and old lesions had healed.	"Side effects included moderate to severe dry skin.

1939	ultram-er	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cervical disk degeneration and lower back pain	Ive been taking Tramadol for 2 weeks now. Ive been taking vicodin and percocuet for 7 months due to Cervial disk degeneration and lower back pain. I have to admit I loved taking Vicodin and percocuet. The problem is that they would knock me out. Tramadol has been awesome. It takes 90% of the pain away and I feel like I actually have energy again. From reading previous comments it sounds like I take a lower dose. Im really happy about that cause if I get use to it then I can up my dose and not feel worried about it.

On the combination of klonopin and prozac, I have not experienced a panic attack in 10 years.

1093	effexor	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	the presumed benefits were to help with a severe depression. in the beginning there was some benefit, ie less suicidal, apathetic, morbid, depressed. but the effects were short lived and dose had to be continually increased. the biggest benefit was probably placebo - feeling like i was getting help, hopeful and trusting in the treatment and doctors.	here we go.the initial effect would be dry mouth and sleepiness, not being able to think straight or function really but once the dose would be acclimatised it would be okay. but it also cased both hypo and hypersomnia. shakiness at times. large cognitive deficits in reading and comprehension (eyes would literally\ physically play tricks not seeing words or substituting others, blind spots)and a general confusion not knowing what i was doing where i was going.nightmares, nightsweats	family doctor initially prescribed wellbutin but a psychologist at the hospital suggested effexor. the dose would be increased as i would adjust and experience setbacks. the gabapentin was added when i had sleep troubles and to augment. many things were also added and subtracted to no avail. a psychiatrist felt the dose could be increased to 375 mg. so it was but i was not under any supervised care other than my family physician. all the above side effects caused me to be sent from specialist to specialist who all had tentative diagnoses ranging from borderline personality, narcolepsy (the modifinil), sleep apnea and restless leg, and finally bi polar. finally a different psychiatrist said it was the drugs!

Often, it would halt the development and the redness and swelling would disappear after a day or two, without the sore blistering/weeping/scabbing.  For my body, Valtrex has proven to be far more effective than either Famvir, or Zoviraz.   It is surprising how many people either do not treat cold sores, or are not aware of any new treatments after Zovirax.	Slight dizziness and tiredness, very minor.

1269	provigil	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	chronic fatigue	Treatment benefits were noticeable but not substantial. I did not respond to 100mg a day as I or the doctor had hoped.

1598	xanax	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	The xanax would act as a downer. It would calm me temporaily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. If the situation was mildly tramatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. The following day I would have residual sedation. The main complain was the addiction. It was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. It did not hurt but until I took it again I felt not quite content and as soon as I would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. I think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body.	As I explained above. Addiction and drowsiness. Your mind and body felt like you were missing something. Until you took the pill you would be anxious but for no reason but as soon as you took the pill your mind would be relived. You would no longer dwell on the anxiety.	Once a day preferably at bedtime but if a situation arose I would have to take another sooner and still one at bedtime in order to sleep.

I can't wax my eyebrows without having the skin peeled off. I know they say to stop 3 days before you wax but it doesn't help. Also, living in florida, my skin became very sensitive to the sunlight. I also get a slight tingling when I apply my sunblock or lotion.	I went to my doctor and asked for a wrinkle treatment. He give me some samples of the creame.

2991	strattera	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar	The treatment helped the patient focus on her daily tasks and enabled her to 'get going' in the morning.  In turn, the patient was able to exercise daily which also helped her maintain concentration throughout the day.  Daily exercise also helped her maintain her moods at a stable level.	At first the patient took the medication before she went to bed, which kept her awake at night and did not allow her to sleep.  After a couple of week with inadequate sleep, she sought help and the doctor prescribed her sleeping medication, Ativan.  It turned out that the poor sleep was due to taking the medication improperly.  When that was corrected, the patient was able to sleep again and was able to function at a high rate.	The patient is being treated for bipolar I disorder, with the most recent episode severe depression.   Being bipolar, she is not able to take anti-depressants as this may induce mania.  Therefore strattera is an effective alternative which enables the patient to function at a higher level thus treating some forms of depression.  Other drugs are taken in combination with strattera to help the patient function at an optimal level each day.

Blood pressure medicine has a mild diaretic which causes frequent urination. Also some drowiness noticed so I take this at night before bed. Thyoid medicine really does not have any side affects for me. Tolerated well.	I take low dose of Prempro each day in the morning. No problems and tolerated well.

I also took yogurt but that did not seem to help much. The cramps came within 48 hours of the first dose.

2451	symbyax	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar disorder	The benefits were great. I really liked Symbyax because it didn't give me side effects like the other medication I used to take did. I would wake up in the day feeling refreshed. As I was taking Seroquil for my Schitzophrenia, I would always wake up feeling exhausted and tired;still, even though I would take the medicine during the nights! I used to be stressed and aggravated all the time before Symbyax and Seroquil. Now that I'm on Symbyax, I'm emotionally numb and the voices in my head vanished. So I had a good nights sleep and didn't wake up as tired as Seroquil used to make me. :]	I didn't really have many side effects besides the medicine making me want to go to sleep. But I'm not complaining, since it does help the voices and the shadows go away for a while. Besides that, my psychiatrist wanted me to take advantage of the other side effect, and that side effect is that Symbyax might make you gain a little weight. So I wouldn't suggest it to people who want to lose weight. I still didn't seen any change in the weight gain and it was about a month when I started taking the lowest dose of Symbyax.

492	meridia	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	obesity	Dramatic loss of weight and inches first week.  Settled into Meridia's Program provided over the Internet (comes with perscription).  Promised myself to follow the rules.  The toughest for me, was not to weigh myself everyday.  Meridia wanted me to check only once a week and I'm glad I refrained.  The thrill of seeing a huge difference each week has kept my knees from complaining.  The strength of Meridia has never lessened.  If I forget to take it, I feel like the bottom of my floor has opened up and I am in free fall.  It really is strange...  When I take it with my vitamins each morning, it gives me a definite feeling of support.  I am loosing 2 lbs each week along with inches.  I'm doing better than what they advertise but that is probably because I have a gym in my home.  I walk 70 miles/mo. and do free weights.  I also love my whey protein porrage in the morning with blueberries, shake for lunch and balanced meal for dinner.  I do eat snacks.  A Starbucks coffee (also made at home), with 1/2 an energy bar... or, an orange.  Responsible eating.  I also understand the dynamics of over eating, being menopausal with depleated hormones.  Meridia has been a life saver for me.  Thanks to my fabulous Doctor, who is also using it.	In 2 mo. (3/4 of the program), 22 lbs weight loss.	3 months, 1 capsule of 10 mg. per day.  After 3 mo., back in to see my Doctor for another check-up.  Continuing on Meridia for another 3 months for achievement of goal.  According to my Doctor, I can use it as a maintenance.  I honestly have no side effects.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive.

347	neurontin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain relief	After suffering a spinal cord injury in 1987 resulting in quadriplegia (C5/C6 complete), I experienced disassociated pain that was concentrated in my right thumb.  The problem got increasingly worse over the following years.  I ended up having to take a lot of ibuprofen and Vicodin, just to relieve the pain announce to allow me to get some work done.  However, the resulting side effects caused me to sleep a lot.  It also lead to depression.  I was finally given a prescription for gabapentin to try out.  It started working almost immediately.  After about two weeks I was rarely having the pain in my thumb anymore.  It doesn't cause me to get sleepy or feel drugged (like the Vicodin) so I have been able to work and concentrate on things once again.  It also seems to have helped with my depression, although that may have more to do with not having to deal with the pain, or the side effects of the pain relievers I was taking before.	I have noticed very little side effects at all.  I was told it may affect the effectiveness of other pain relievers, but so far I have not noticed that -- when I needed to take a Vicodin when my thumb did still hurt on occasion.

I suffered from impulsive behaviors, probably the most harmful/dangerous of them being binge-eating and bulimia.

Now I feel like a normal person--not obsessed with food, I eat when I am hungry, stop when satiated.  I have lost a LOT of weight (20 pounds in 3 months without dieting/counting calories, etc.)...nothing was wrong with my metabolism, it was the impulsive eating, stealing food from others, throwing it up (which gave me a high--not just to get rid of the calories, but it calmed me...).  I love the Lamictal for this because it's not like some meds that make you lose weight by destroying the appetite.  I am just a normal person now!

378	lamotrigine	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	I felt better for the first few days, mood-wise.  But then I got depressed again.  So I guess that's not a benefit.	"I've always been one to freak out at the slightest appearance of illness - I have anxiety as well as bipolar disorder.  When I was told that lamotrigine (the first drug I've been on for bipolar) caused a potentially fatal rash, I decided that this time, I was going to try not to worry.  One out of ten people experience a rash on the drug - and I tried to be rational - that means I'm likely to be one of the nine that doesn't.

Oh, was I ever wrong.

Firstly, the lamotrigine didn't help with moods.  I wanted to die for two days more badly than I ever had in my life on this drug. It was excruciating.  Luckily, I have a lot of support, and I (obviously) didn't kill myself.

I couldn't sleep.  I lay awake most nights until 7am.  I eventually passed out and got maybe 4-6 hours of sleep.  This is barely better than the sleep I get when I'm hypomanic.  And we all know how bad it is when bipolar people don't sleep.  Luckily, the meds did seem to keep me from going upwards mood-wise.  I also had to pee ALL THE TIME, which was not fun.

That brings me to the rash.
I first noticed a few raised bumps on my inner forearms.  I thought it would go away, that I shouldn't freak out - I wasn't going to get the rash, right?  And the next morning, I was covered in a slightly raised, red rash, even on my face and hands.  I went to the clinic, and the doctor said I was having an allergic reaction.  He told me to just go home and stop taking the lamotrigine.  He knew nothing about it or the fact that it causes rashes.  It got worse, and by night-time I was freaked out.  I called a nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room.  I did, and they had me stay the night to make sure I didn't have Steven Johnson Syndrome.  Luckily, I don't.  I just have something called ""drug eruption.""

Even if it's not going to kill me, it's never fun being covered in red blotches.  I still am and it's been three days.  I'm afraid to go to the Starbucks around the corner.  My verdict?  Lamictal isn't worth it.  Don't risk it."	"""I have taken this for 5 days and its not working"""

I don&#039;t have bipolar disorder, but had some manic or agitated behavior at the time (which could&#039;ve been caused by the Zoloft). Doctor prescribed it and thought it would help. It increased my energy, and I began to workout more. For some reason, I woke up early every morning around 8AM while I was on Abilify. I&#039;m not a morning person so that&#039;s really early for me. Also I felt &quot;speeded up&quot;, overly confident and optimistic. I had to stop taking it because I experienced odd involuntary tongue movements. I was also on Seroquel which is in the same family of drugs as Abilify, so the doctor thought the combination is what caused the odd effect."""

Aside from the usual drowsiness, I had a hangover feeling in the morning and as a result took the pill 2 hours before bed which resolved it. The warning label states sex drive may lessen, but with me it increased, quite dramtically actually.

I was prescribed a mild dose (10mg) of celexa by my doctor. At the time, (being a teenager) I was frequently tired anyway. I think this is why I did not notice the side effect at first. But years later, I decided to try going off it, and discovered an increase in energy and motivation. After that, I tried a few other drugs like lexipro (which gave me the same side effects), and Wellbutrin (which made me feel manic, highly anxious and stressed). I had tried the Wellbutrin because I was told it would not make me sleepy. Unfortunately, in increased my anxiety to the extreme.

2631	depo-provera	4	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	preventing pregnancy	In one year, I only had two periods. My periods before Depo were 2-3 days and very light, on Depo they were longer and heavier. It is so convenient not having to remember to take a pill everyday at the same day. It was also 100% effective with preventing pregnancy for me.	The first side effect I noticed was my complete lack of sex drive. After this came the ridiculous mood swings that caused fights with my boyfriend over nothing. I would just cry for no reason at all and I felt like I was going insane. Breast tenderness was also becoming an annoyance because it would last for months. While these side effects were severe to me, the worst is the huge concave I now have in my thigh. While I had a total of four injections, only one caused a huge dimple. It's really embarassing and extremely noticable and I'm not sure why it happened. The doctor said it has happened to a few other patients including discoloration of the injection site. This is when I got off Depo and switched to Seasonique... Hopefully, this will work out better.	"""At first, I loved the depo shot. I got 6 weeks after giving birth and I haven&#039;t had a period since, which is wonderful.

I weigh as much as I did at 40 weeks pregnant and I&#039;ve only been on the shot for 7 months. My next shot is scheduled for next month, but I am switching back to a pill.

3108	ortho-tri-cyclen	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control/control of menstrual cycle	The Ortho Tri-Cyclen provided effective birth control, and it also did cause my mentstrual cylcle to be more regular. My periods were less heavy, and I did not have such severe menstrual cramping each month while I was taking the pills. There are no other benefits to taking the pill that I am aware of.	I experienced migraine headaches several times per week where I could not do anything other than lay down with the lights off while on this medication. At first, I had no idea what was causing them, but my doctor informed me that my symptoms could be indicative of a more severe side effect, and she therefore advised me to stop taking them. They also caused some bloating and moodiness.	The Ortho Tri-Cyclen birth control pills are a low dosage progesterone treatment that is intended to prevent pregnancy. I was required to take one pill every day. My understanding is that I experienced a relatively rare side effect with the migraines. I have not heard any similar complaints from friends who were taking the same pill, other than complaints about weight gain, bloating and mild acne.

Dry mouth.  It made me very, very tired, so I take it before bed and sleep wonderfully. With 40mg dosage - increased sweating, faintness, nearly passing out.	I started with the 20mg dosage and it seemed to be working pretty well until about a month in when I had a bad anxiety attack.  After seeing the doctor, she upped me to 40mg.  After one dosage of 40mg, I nearly passed out twice and started profusely sweating.  My hearing also went all funny.  The doctor advised me to drop back down to 20mg and then try to go back up to the 40mg.  Emotionally, I felt better after the 40mg, even after nearly fainting, but the side effects were very bad.
641	seasonique	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	I thought the benefits would be one period every 3 months, pregnancy prevention, regulated periods. I also read that they would be lighter and shorter and help with acne. WRONG!	Well I was quite leary about starting Seasonique, I was already taking Yaz and I loved it, but 4 periods a year why pass that up. From the moment I started taking it, it wasn't a decreased sex drive, I had none at all, which made the birth control completely useless to me. In addition to that, the acne just kept getting worse, I didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasional blemish here and there. It started getting worse on my face, then my chest, then my back, (it's not just one here or one there, my back, chest, and chin are seriously covered) I've even had one on my ribs! Crazy! My boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. It was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explanation). I went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. Lastly, I've been fretting the last 2 weeks because I still haven't gotten my period! I never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. The Dr. said I would bleed between... still not bleeding! I've taken 3 pregnancy tests, wasted 10 bucks on each! Oh yeah, I've been crying for no reason at all the last month. I started crying over some lady I didn't even know at work. I do not recommend taking Seasonique. I know it must be expensive although I don't know how much because my Dr. gave me sample packs and I'm not going to bother refilling it. Also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. It wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and I still have no clue as to why I haven't gotten a period yet). I've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. This is the first time I tried one where I only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. If you are looking for a good pill, Yaz worked great for me and I never had any breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, loss of sex drive, acne or anything. Hope this helps.	1 pill every day for 12 weeks, then 1 week of period pills

The topical treatment was used along side of an antibiotic for a series of weeks.(4-6) The acne condition improved, but never completely.

2265	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	mild depression	The benefits were amazing.  After 3 days, I felt good.  I didnot want to stay home and not see anybody.	A little sleepiness at first.	I have always been depressed.  This flared up considerable when I was having trouble with endometrious.  I was just sick of myself.  Within a few days of taking Lexapro, I felt beeter and could make reliable decisions about things.  After my hysterectomy, I needed the meds to work with the HRT.  I just needed a little boost because my body was not responding to the hormone therapy like it should.

3991	fosamax	4	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	osteoporosis	in theory, my bones should have gotten stronger, as measured by the bone scan done at my gynecologist office once every 18 months	I first tried the tablets and they would sit on my stomach as if I had a brick for breakfast. So I tried the oral solution which, in fact, was better on the stomach but,still, not completely without side effects. Most of the days I took Fosamax I had a slight stomach discomfort during the morning.	I took Fosamax for almost 4 years and after 2 bone density scans which showed no improvement  I decided to stop the treatment, against my doctor advice which was to take Fosamax for at least 5 years. I believe that we still do not know enough about how the bone keeps itself healthy and that bone scans are not yet reliable. It's a big business and I finally refused to keep a medication that is so hard on the digestive system and can also have very dangerous side effects (frozen bones, I believe it is called). I still have to be convinced that a low density bone is not necessarily stronger than a bone with more density. Waiting for more research I am trying to walk as much as possible and to follow a reasonable diet. And to be at peace with myself...  Thanks!

872	paxil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"Helped me to feel better.  Lessened anxiety, panic attacks, tension, emotional exhaustion.  I was able to tolerate being around people better because talking did not seem so loud. Once I was used to the drug, it helped me get out of bed and function in day to day life better (falling asleep & getting out of bed was a serious struggle).  Eventually with the combined therapy, I pretty much now feel like myself again, just with less energy reserve and ability to have discipline with my routine.  (For instance, I can't get up early, during the 5am, 6am hours and get to work on time like I use to.  In fact I'm late for everything now which is out of my character) Can' tolerate multiple loads of stress with calmness and collectivity like I use to.  Otherwise day to day life is manageble as long as I obey my bodies new limitations.
I didn't gain weight or increase in appetite.  I struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat."	"This drug gave me alot of strange sensations.  When I turned my head left or right, I got this mild scratchy or whip like noise in my ears along with a tingling in my head; also my vision seemed to briefly black out.  This lasted for many months. I thought it was perhaps not real or just in my head. My psychiatrist called it ""tracking"" and confirmed it as a known side affect with paxil use.  I didn't bother to worry anymore about it.  This passed after some months.  I no longer get it.  I felt very dizzy and sleepy at times.  I'd fall asleep anywhere.  I don't know if it was the depression, the paxil, lack of sleep, my body trying to heal from stress.  Sometimes I felt like I was living life from inside of a fish bowl (from sensory standpoint). I was chronically late to my job of 8 years for 2 years straight after suffering this nervous breakdown (due to spousal abuse).  Subsequently, I was fired.
When I miss doses of the paxil, especially 2 or more in a row, I feel like I did when I just started them.  I can barely get out of bed and function.  I'm super sleepy.  I feel drunk.  I'm dizzy.  I will literally go missing for 2 days.  It takes a few days of regular doses to get me back into my normal mode."	Initially I was only prescriped paxil and xanax.  I took only these for a few months under my PMD.  Dose was increased from a lower one to 20mg as my depression and anxiety symptoms were still moderately severe, impairing my work performace and other quality of life.  Withing a few months I was referred to a psychiatrist for med mgmt. After less than 6 months, Wellbutrin was added to the cocktail at a dose of 150mg, then increased to 300mg XL once daily.  Ambien was also presccribed as my symptoms did not allow me to fall asleep.  Life greatly improved within the next 8 months to a year.  I weaned off the ambien and xanax completely.  Still take the paxil and wellbutrin at the same doses.  Also had counseling during all of this time.

Hopefully this ""clean bill of health"" will continue as I begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. The benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. Tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. My cancer was highly estrogen-positive. Lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. Effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits."	Side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. I had hot flashes that were quite severe. They often came without warning especially at mealtime. I also had some body aches and pains. Vaginal dryness was also severe. My period became erratic. After 2 years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. My period has been non-existant for 4 months.

In November 2009 I was prescribed SEROQUEL by a Urgent Care Physician. Immediately I found its calming effects to be extremely relieving to my mania. I did, however, find it difficult to maintain a functioning state due to its sedating effects. I then switched to SEROQUEL XR and found a much more successful experience. I was initially given 400mg SEROQUEL XR paired with 10mg LEXAPRO. While initially a good way to stop the mania, I found 400mg to be too much to function on. I decided to halve my SEROQUEL XR dose to 200mg continuing to take 10mg of LEXAPRO. This combo has been great and I am so much calmer and feel way more in control of my life. I do, however, find the sedating effects to be difficult upon awaking in the morning. I try to offset this by ensuring that I receive a full 8-10 hour rest after administering a dosage.

Before the medication, my skin was horribly dry and flaky. The changes did not take place overnight. I would say that it took about 3-4 months to see any improvement in my hair and skin.	I really experienced very few side effects, if any.  Initially, they started me off on a very low dosage because they just thought it was simply hypothyroidism but after a blood test, they realized that I has Hashimooto's thyroidities and moointored it more closely. At low dosages, there wasn't much improvement in my symptoms. I do have excessive sweating but they aren't sure if that is the synthroid or menopause and the doctors don't really seem concerned.	Initially I was being treated for high blood pressure and put on topral but they did a TSH test and realized that something was wrong with my thyroid. I was originally started off on a very low dosage ( 12.5 mcg/daily) and had to keep going back for blood work every month. Slowly they increased it until they did another test and found out that it was Hashimoto's thyroiditis. At that point, they increased the dosage to 75 mcg/daily and so far it has worked out but I do have to keep having the TSH levels checked.

My case probably isn't a perfect control because I lost a high paying job, moved to another state, and moved in with my girlfriend when I began taking the medication.  Within 4 months, started a brand new job and encountered other new stressors.  

I can attribute some of the loss of libido to job related stress and moving in with my girlfriend of 5 years.  I would guess the effects on libido would be very minimal had my job and living situations remained constant.

I'm overall much happier having thicker hair than I would be with a consistent sex drive.  I am able to get more work done and focus more on important life goals than being constantly distracted with sex.  Instead of wanting sex 5 times per week, I only want it twice per month now.  Again, this is probably a plus"	"I started slowing losing hair when I was 23-24.  The hair loss was unnoticeable until I turned 27.  My receding hairline started to become very apparent at 27, especially in my part line.  I began taking propecia when I turned 28 and it appears to have regrown hair on the back and sides of my scalp and has slowed my receding hairline.  Unfortunately, it appears that I am still developing a minor bald spot in the middle of my scalp.  

Based on my current rate of hair loss, I'm guessing that I will maintain a healthy head of hair for the next 4-5 years.  At 35, I probably won't care how my hair looks because I'll be well out of the dating game.  

I don't think Propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness, but I feel it would be highly effective for others.  Anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  The receding hairline will probably continue, but at a much slower pace.  I may eventually go completely bald regardless, but I honestly feel I've saved 3-5 years of youthful appearance."

Slight increase in skin sensitivity, with stinging and mild redness experienced only after washing, and occasional slight flaking around mouth and eye areas. Increased sensitivity to UV light, necessitating daily use of high PPD sunscreen.	I started applying a pea-sized amount of the Retin-A cream on every second night about one hour after washing. After two weeks, because there were no adverse effects for me I started using the cream nightly. With nightly usage I experienced very slight side-effects of sensitivity, slight redness after washing and occasional slight flaking. None of these effects were severe so I continued with nightly treatment. After approximately one month I experienced gradual lessening in severity and frequency of comedonic acne. Comedones still formed, but were less likely to become inflamed/infected. Slight reduction in surface oiliness noted. After about 10 weeks I noted a slight improvement in sundamage and skin texture.

"I held on to the prescription for 18 months, but never filled it - until I decided I should, completely expecting to fail.  I did as prescribed and continued to smoke through the first week or so.  One night I saw only six cigarettes left. I became anxious and actually went out and BOUGHT TWO PACKS! Leaving the store, I felt like a junkie who just scored a fix, and, I was disgusted.  But - I smoked them, finishing the two packs in a bit over a week, which was much less smoking than I had ever done.  ..And,.. after smoking the last remaining cigarette, I magically never smoked again.  

It's been over a year and I can almost qualify as one who has no cravings because they are so, so rare (maybe once every four or five months) and they last for less than a nano-second. 

I'm so smoke free and amazed at two things: 1. How easy it was to stop because of the Zyban, and, 2. That I ever smoked at all - even though I did for 41 years. Other than being smart enough to finally get the prescription filled, I deserve no credit because there has been no need for any great will on my part. I have absolutely no cravings, no desires, no urges to have to will myself through.  They simply don't happen."
2307	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Deppression disappeared. Anxiety disappeared. Since I have been on Lexapro I have realised I have been depressed most of my life. I have a very strong family history of major depression. I was in denial to the fact I was depressed. When you have always been depressed you don't know any different. Since Lexapro I have felt alot calmer and happier. The intense guilt I felt about everything has almost gone. My mind would also constantly relieve traumatic past events and mistakes I had made. I really didn't ever want to wake up in the morning - but now I do. The depressive need to sleep in the day time has gone. I am also becoming much less socially isolated, more confident and have began ejoying life. I would have liked to find Lexapro Many years ago.	"I started taking 5mg daily for the first two weeks and did feel an increase in anxiety which subsided after a couple of days. When I increased to 10 mg the anxiety returned and then again subsided. I also felt ""far away and fuzzzy headed"" for about 3 weeks. Insomnia was also an initial side effect. After 6 weeks I am not experiencing any side effects and am extremely grateful for my improved mood."	I began taking Lexapro for 6 weeks. I started at 5mg for two weeks and then increased it to 10mg. I plan to continue taking it for a long time as i have never felt better.

88	pristiq	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	This is an NSRI, different from an SSRI because it works on more than one brain chemical. When an SSRI is ineffective or a patient finds that after a period of time a working drug stops working and symptoms of depression return they may be advised to try an NSRI. This was the case with me. I have been treated for my depression for years and had done extremely well for periods of time on several different drugs at different times. Moving from one to the next as I bottomed out on each. Celexa and Lexapro being the most recent. When Lexapro let me down after a couple of years I was advised to try Pristiq which was just released only a few months before my doctor suggested it. I was extremely hesitant as I did not want to go through another adjustment period of sleeplessness, headaches, possible weight gain, sexual issues, etc. You know the drill if you have taken drugs for deperession. So I chose to stay on my Lexapro and be depressed, hoping that it would start working again at a higher dose. Wrong. Getting to the end of my rope with my depression I finally decided to bite the bullet and try the Prestiq. My depression disappeared within 3 weeks leaving me feeling better than I had in months. I began smiling again and fully functioning doing the things I enjoy and had let slide. My sense of well being and hopefulness for the future returned.	Honestly, none for me. I sleep, did not gain an ounce, in fact I lost a small amount of weight even though I did not need to, no sexual side effect at all! Only thing that was tough was waiting for the dosage level to become theraputic in my system, which as I mentioned took about 3 weeks.	"""I am 37 yrs old, suffered 8 mths with unbearable pain.

Horrible, wretched diarrhea. I lost six pounds in five days. I could barely eat because I couldn't keep anything down. I had to survive on white bread slices, crackers and water. Anything else caused diarrhea. It was so bad that I called my doctor and asked her to prescribe me something else. She told me that the two days remaining on my perscription were just extra insurance to make sure my infection was gone before surgery. She basically said she would normally only prescribe five days so with that I discontinued use. Feel better now but still have diarrhea. Been off for 1 day.

The vinegar made the nail bed inhospitable to fungus and nails grew in perfect, solving this 20+ year problem that plagued me.  I recommend anyone suffering from nail bed fungus to try this.

Before taking this medication I would have bouts of this pain every few months during stressful times and it would take weeks to go away.  Since taking this medication during that three week period two years ago I have had no more syptoms of h-pylori despite several stressful time periods.	I don't remember any.

I lived in an apartment with my boyfriend and attended school, no job. But that's all I did. Never made it out of the apartment, never went out, I lived in a huge city, made no friends, just an absolute mess. My emotions were a wreck and I felt absolutely helpless. I cried alll the time and I started having panic attacks out of nowhere, which I had absolutely NO idea what was going on. I just dealt with them in horror. I drank and did drugs, but it only made things worse. My doctor prescribed this drug and it did absolute wonders, within a week, I was starting to feel the weight being lifted off my shoulders. Within 3 weeks, I was able to drive in traffic, and open my blinds to let the sun in. Within 2 months, I was back to normal! I have the occasional off days, but who doesn't? The thought of possibly being dependent on this medication scares me because of how hard it's said to be weaned off of it, but I'm too scared to even TRY coming off effexor because of the withdrawal symptoms I experienced before.

I had two concerns for this oral medication.  First, I was skeptical that this prescription for amoxicillin would be any different in terms of taste and that my son would also throw it up.  Also, being that my son is a diabetic coupled with the fact that he was sick, I was concerned that this medication might have sugars that would affect his blood sugar readings.  I found no real difference in his health for the first two to three days but in the days following, his health improved dramatically to the point where we almost forgot to take it.  Understanding that the antibiotic needed to be taken for the full ten days in order to be the most effective, we continued to take it to the end of the ten days.	My son did not notice/experience any side effects.  There did not seem to be any physical reaction with the drug except that he became better within days.	I gave my son a teaspoon of amoxicillin after each of three meals per day for ten days in total.

When I was 14 I tried Clindoxyl gel for 8 months and saw little to no effect. It only made my skin drier than before. I went to my doctor and asked for a solution and she prescribed Benzaclin Gel. I applied it every single night after washing my face and within a month I saw results. My skin was brighter and my acne had almost completely stopped after 2 months of using it. After the third month, my skin was amazing and had no breakouts at all. I started to use the Oil Cleansing Method and my skin was better than it had ever been. After I stopped the Gel, my acne came back within 2 weeks. I am using it again now and my skin is better than ever."""
1	nasonex	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	congested sinuses	Traeatment with Nasonex was effective at controlling some of my congestion before sinus surgery and all of it after surgery.  The treatment also controlled my allergies to cats and dogs as a bonus!  I stayed 4 days at a freinds house with a dog and was without sneezing and stuffiness, however my asthma was still an issue.	Immediate side effects that I noticed were with my immune system.  I got sick (colds and upper respiratory infections) more easily and I had one bug bite that became infected and took a long time to heal.  I also noticed that I put on a few pounds (2-3) but am not sure if that is related or not.

At first there was burning, after bowel movements, then increased to severe burning all the time, then to pain, and finally severe pain (could not sit or lay down). No hemorrhoids, tears, or fisures, but the pain continued, even if no bowel movements for days. Finally stopped taking the medication at the end of August 2009, but the symptoms continue even now (Feb 2010), although not nearly as bad. Now the pain just makes me sit sideways, but at least I can sit and lay down to sleep.	I had never been diagnosed with high blood pressure, but had recently gained several pounds because of the double round of steroids I was put on because of a severe skin rash (seasonal allergic reaction). Since we had recently moved I didn't have a PCP yet and the rash on my arms looked like it may have been getting infected, I went to a local emergent care center and saw a doctor there. They took my blood pressure and immediately put me on Benicar HCT, 20 mg, once a day. I took the medication as prescribed until the anal pain got to be too bad. Since going off the medication my BP is a little elevated but I'm reluctant to go back on any meds, especially no one seems to be willing to admit the Benicar caused this problem or is offering any solutions to help it get better.

Actually , I started feel worse about day 3 or 4.  The drug seemed to be enhancing the sinusitus symptoms!	The treatment side effects of Levaquin were very similar to my sinusitis symptoms, hence the fact I stayed on the drug for several days.  Side effects included headache, dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea (nausea is not a symptom of sinusitus that I ever experienced before).  The side effects slowly got worse the longer I took the drug.	I asked for the drug in liquid form, as I have difficulty swallowing many pills.  I took the drug as recommended, but the symptoms did not get better.  As I mentioned earlier, the symptoms got worse.  I called my doctor's office on the third day and was told that the symptoms I was experiencing was the infection.  By day 5 I knew it was the drug, and stopped taking it.

I developed 1 blister which I thought was herpes. I had not had a herpes outbreak in years. I started the acyclovir and noticed more and different complaints every day.  I first got a lesion on the entrance to the ear canal and more accompanying the first one on my lower chin.  Then my lower teeth began to become painful, as if I had a great toothache.  After about 4 days, I began to feel exhausted and unable to snap out of my fatigue.  The next day I awoke and had a sensation that my mouth was not fully moving.  Later the eye began to remain open and would not blink. The 3rd day of these symtoms, I devloped total paralysis of the left face. I saw 1 of my doctors immediately.

1753	topamax	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	The number of migraines were reduced from 20+ a month to 12 or even less.  There have been some months when I have had only 5 or less migraines.  More importantly, the intensity of the migraines is considerably reduced.  On a pain scale of 1-10, I would have 12 or 15+ pain, that no amount of medication helped, and they would last for 3 to 5 days.  Now, when I do get a migraine, it's usually at a 2 or 3 pain level, and I rarely need to take more than 1 Relpax for relief.	One rather odd side effect, which others on the drug have commented upon, is that you forget words.  I've always been very articulate, and it can be frustrating to be in the middle of a conversation, or when I was doing training sessions, to suddenly go blank and be completely unable to remember a word I've used all my life.  Also, at one point I decided to go off the medication in the vain hope I could manage the migraines without drugs.  Even coming off the Topamax over a period of months, I gained 20 pounds.	I started on the usual dosage of 25mg in the morning and evening, then after 2 weeks increased it to 50mg twice a day.  Most people stay at this level, however, I seem to have a very high metablisim when it comes to medication, and anything I've taken for migraines always has to be increased beyond normal dosage in order to work.  Therefore, my neurologist increased the dosage to 200 mg a day, and after about a year when that no longer worked, we went to 300mg a day, which I know is high for used in migraine treatment. However, I've been on almost every migraine medication there is over the years, and there is nothing else that works.  I'm hoping for more breakthroughs in migraine research, before I end up at 400mg a day and forget half my vocabulary!

I found it slightly more difficult to drive while under the influence of the drug, and oftentimes I caught myself spacing out.  Sun exposure seemed to strengthen the drug's effect, and being in the sun made me lethargic and sometimes even dizzy.  Overall, I always felt as though I was on an irregular level of consciousness, and not in the same mental place as surrounding people not on the drug.	I was told to take one or 1/2 tablet approximately 30 minutes before undergoing an event that I predicted would inflict anxiety.  My stress was effectively reduced during family meals and going out to restaurants.  However, I took 1/2 tablet before receiving a vaccination shot and, although I did not pass out as usual, I still became lightheaded and dizzy as a result of the needle.  Perhaps a whole tablet would have eliminated these effects.  In the end, I couldn't get used to feeling like I was on drugs while trying to work, drive, etc. so I decided to not refill my prescription and began seeing my therapist more often instead.
3596	differin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	uneven skin colour, anti-aging	My skin has become dramatically clearer and it has a fresh glow that I am very happy with.  My skin is smoother, finer, and the darker areas on my forehead (related to sun exposure) have faded almost completely.	Mild redness in the first three or four weeks, especially after exfoliating in the morning (which is my habit, not something recommended by my dermatologist though I have not asked).  It is a lot more urgent that I get moisturizer on after washing my face in the morning than it used to be before starting this treatment.  My face feels very tight and uncomfortable until I get the moisturizer on.	Before the treatment, I had noticed my skin was becoming dull and a bit leathery, and some wrinkles were setting in to my forehead. This is all substantially improved, and I'm so glad I shelled out for this cream.

I had previously been on synthroid and it&#039;s generic for over 20 years with no problems and suddenly became intolerant with debilitating side effects.

1126	evista	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	osteopenia associated with menopause	The treatment benefits are long term.  There is no immediate benefit to be seen.  My doctor advised me that a follow-up dexa scan should be performed in two years to determine if the treatment is effective in reversing or at least arresting the osteopenia.  The drug is supposed to reduce risk of breast cancer.	I experienced some mild hot flashes during the month I took the drug.  These hot flashes were not of the intensity that I experienced when I first started to experience menopause.  I did have more ackiness in my bones and joints when I first starting taking it but these went away after the first few weeks.	"I was given one month's free sample of Evista by my doctor.  I took one 60 mg pill each morning with 600 mg Calcium with Vitamin D as directed by my doctor.  I also walk 30 minutes daily on my treadmill, again at my Dr.'s direction.  I refilled the presciption at a local discount ""member's only"" store and paid $106 for one month of the drug. I have since purchased the drug on line for about half the cost.  Once I receive it, I will resume taking the drug.  Looks like I'll have about a two week vacation.  Biggest concerns about taking this drug are blood clots and stroke.  You are not allowed to smoke and alcohol consumption needs to be kept to a low level because it's not good for the bones. Other lifestlye issues related to healthy bones are followed."

My doctor ascertained that these were most likely tension headaches. The morning after taking the first dose, I had no headache, and I remained headache-free for 2 days.  Now, on the third day, the headache is returning, so I plan to take another dose tonight.	All day on the day after taking the medication, I had symptoms that resembled low blood sugar.  I was very jittery after a small amount of caffeine (less than I normally drink).  All day I had this unpleasant effect.  But it was not as bad as having a headache all day.

248	wellbutrin-xl	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	I presented with General Anxiety Disorder and Aggitated Depression.  I was unfocused, angry, anxious and had racing thoughts.  Wellbutrin XL helped with depression, unfocused thinking and racing thoughts.  I was more focused during the day and was able to complete tasks.  It also helped so that I would not fly off the handle and it helped me stay out of bed.  In a nutshell, it helped me with energy.  A main help was with the sexual side effects of Lexapro, a seratonin reuptake inhibitor.  Lexapro would dimish my libido and make it difficult to reach orgasm.  Wellbutrin really helped to conteract these side effects and gave me even energy during the day.	The only side effects from Wellbutrin is that sometimes I had difficulty getting to sleep if I took the dose later in the day (past noon).	The treatment includes Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.  This is a time released tablet and delivers medication during the day.  In addition, I would take Lexapro 5 to 10 mg for the aggitation and racing thoughts.  This was really helpful with anger and outbursts.  If I had trouble sleeping I would take Trazadone 10 mg at night, and if I did not have it I would take Simply Sleep or Tylenol PM, but only one tablet.  Sometimes I would cut the Trazadone in half for a 5 mg dose.  I have had low grade anxiety and depression for many years.  I have been menopausal for 4 years.  I have a lot of stress in my life with two teenage boys and we live in a high end community outside D.C. with cut throat competition on every corner.
170	zomig	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	THe zomig nasal spray is generally very effective in curing migraine. 80% of the time the pain is 75% or more gone within an hour. Another 15% of the time it takes up to 2 hours.  5% of the time the pain is only lessen.  However lately some of the single dose units do not discharge the medication properly. Instead of a spray, you get a drop or two.  When this happens, the frequency of the pain not going away by at least 75% goes up. A couple of times it seemed virtually ineffective.  If the quality control doesn't improve, I may have to switch to a different Triptan.	Generally I fell a little dull or numb in the head, very slightly dizzy. Rarely there is a little tightness in the chest.	Since insurance only covers 2 per week and the doctor doesn't want me to take it too ofter for fear of rebound headaches, I generally wait until the headache is fairly bad and is interfering with my ability to work.  I will frequently take Tramadol, ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetophenamin earlier. These work maybe 25% of the time, or take the pain down enough so that I can avoid taking the tripan.

The biggest side-effect was that it made me experience shock-waves through my head and sometimes even my body, just like if someone would have turned on and off a lamp very quickly. That side-effect ended the same time I stopped taking Seroquel. The other one was that everything started to smell and taste very bad. It�s hard to explain exactly how, but it was a mix of vodka and mould. After I stopped taking the medication it took 2 weeks for the taste/smell-problem to disapear.	I was prescribed with Seroquel after I was released from hospital after a period of deep depression to help me to sleep better and stop me from becoming hypomanic.

At this stage, the hives were in full swing so the medication was only 50% effective but it helped enough for me to resist scratching myself.  As time went by, the itching slowly subsided and the hives went away (lasted about five days).	When I first took Benadryl, I took two tablets (50 mg) on an empty stomach.

The side effect that experienced throughout the course of treatment was the persuasive bitter taste in the mouth. Other than that single side effect I did not experience any other side effects that I am aware of.	The treatment details using the combination of Biaxin and Flagyl together was to assist in the eradication of the cell wall deficient bacteria called Borrelia Burgdorferi.

After being on the medicine as many years as I have, I don't think it is as effective as others may be, but I have tried many...Prozac,Zoloft and numerous others I don't remember the name of and nothing worked as well for me as Paxil..Another note is that anxiety runs in my family and a few aunts and uncles in my family have had the same good luck with Paxil.

It is a very painful, itchy rash (appears like a heat rash) which I get reagardless of sunblock usage.  This is apparently a fairly common condition in women of fair complexion (like me) who go to very sunny areas after a long period of no sun exposure.  It began happening when I was in my 20's and it took several years (and the Internet as well as a dermatologist) to diagnose what was happening.

However, I never got to the point where I didn't have the one cigarette a day and the side effects were so severe that I had to stop taking the drug.	The worst were the terrible nausea, gas and abdominal distress.  I would be so nauseous after taking the drug that I would have to lie down for about forty five minutes before I could function.  Also, as the treatment wore on, the gas pains became so painful that I just had to stop taking the drug.  The gas pains grew more severe over time.

The erthyromycin is an orally administrated drug for the treatment of bacterial infections. Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, are fairly common.  Although I did not have any vomiting reactions the other disturbances did occur. The treatment with the erthyromycin did not relieve the cystic acne.

(Before adding erinn, was down to approx. 8 migraine days a month.)  Topamax seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers such as changes in altitude, barometric pressures, humidity levels, environmental triggers such as smoke, strong smells, loud noises, and food triggers such as dark chocolate.  Before topamax all of these things would cause migraines to start very easily.  After settling in on topamax these things didn't bother me like they used to.	"When first starting the drug, diet soda tasted metallic and downright horrible.  There was definitely an adjustment period of getting used to the drug and increasing the dosage in small increments was important.  I could feel changes in my brain that are hard to describe.  Almost like the top was a little bit ""lifted"".  It was worth getting through this period for the results, though.  They definitely went away as my body got accustomed to the drug.  Once that happened, the migraines lessened and one pleasant side effect was that I didn't snack as often.  No ""mindless munching.""  I lost some weight without trying.  I felt that it was difficult to retrieve thoughts or find the right word at times.  I found it would take a few seconds longer to put my thoughts into words.  Felt a little ""spacey.""  As I mentioned before, I got through it after getting used to the drug.  It took several weeks but after having 17 migraine days a month and going down to 8 it was worth it."	Started at 25mg 2x a day for several days and started titrating up by adding 25mg to the evening dose every 3-4 days, depending on how I felt.  Got up to 100 mg. a day for the first year.  After moving and talking to my new doctor, she suggested increasing the dose to see if I could have less migraines than the 10-12 I was having so I titrated up to 200mg a day and my migraines went down to 8 a month.

"I suffered with mild acne and many whiteheads that were resistant to all other topical and antibiotic treatment.

The first time it was highly effective (side effects were tolerable and worth it as I got great results) so I stopped after 4 months. after about a year the acne returned (much less than previously) so I took another course and after that it was definitely gone. 
There are side effects but if you can tolerate them, it is a very effective treatment.
I had to do a pregnancy test prior to starting each course and full blood test and had to take oral contraceptives throughout the treatment as there is a risk of birth defects. I also had to see dermatologist every 2 weeks initially then monthly and have my blood tests repeated.

For the topical condition, diphenhydramine was preferred.	Drowsiness.  Slight dizziness, but not remarkable.  I also thought that the drug's slow-release effect may not be as modulated as one would hope since the drowsiness and related symptoms came in spurts rather than in a constant flow, if you know what i mean.  I did not find that caffeine was helpful to promote alertness and I was nervous about driving while taking this particular medication.	"""I suffered from hives caused by friction, sunlight, temperature change, exercise, and showering for over 10 years, getting increasingly worse as I got older.

I didn't feel an actual absence of pain as much as I felt ""oh well, gee gosh, I have pain.  Isn't that a bummer.""  In other words, the medication seemed to be more about changing my attitude towards the pain rather then actual reduction of pain.  I subsequently
stopped taking it and turned to tylenol with codeine.  This worked much better in my opinion.  I subsequently refused any additional prescriptions for vicodin and requested tylenol with codeine instead.  I have since switched to a natural pain relief option that is a combination of white willow, feverfew, skullcap, and kelp.  It is called ""Relief"".  I believe the manufacturer is ""Nature's Way.""  Although, I am in daily pain for assorted issues (structural) I avoid medicating myself unless it is particularly dibilitating.

After taking paxil for about 3 days, I had a job as a courier and I caught myself singing and dancing to a song on the radio.  I couldn't believe it, I had not done that for about 5 months.  Also there was the great side effect of appetite loss, especially at first, where I had actually forgotten to eat all day on several occasions.

Also, I gained weight and felt like I was retaining water. A week before my period I would feel weak and feverish.	My OBGYN explained that this oral contraceptive uses a synthetic progestin known as drospirenone. He suggested that it might be the cause of my negative side effects.

2070	metformin	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	type 2 diabetes	In the beginning of my treatment for type 2 diabetes, I found the benefits of Glucophage or metformin for me to be two-fold.  Number one, metformin did seem to lower my blood sugar over a short amount of time in the beginning.  Number two, as a medication I found necessary in my life, I have found it fairly inexpensive to purchase as a generic drug.	The treatment side effects I experienced were in the beginning.  At the very start of taking Glucophage, I had diarrhea.  It did go away after some time on the drug.	"""A month ago, I was placed on Metformin ER 500 mg twice a day after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (HbA1C of 7.9). I, like so many on this forum, experienced violent diarrhea for the first 7 to 10 days, which then suddenly ceased. For the first time in my life, I have since experienced life as someone without a weight problem. I no longer think about food ruminatively, have to remind myself to eat, and I stop eating when full (eating smaller portions than previously). I have not had my blood glucose re-tested yet so can not speak to the effectiveness of  Metformin for glucose control, but I expect much improvement, even at this sub clinical dose. I have been losing 2 to 3 lbs per week without much effort. It has been life changing."""

Apparently my dermatologist had used this treatment on a number of patients and had received a good success rate.  I did not see any benefits over the time I used the product (3 months) but was advised that I needed to continue treatment.	There were no noticeable side effects that I was aware of.  The product is an ointment with a rather oily feel and needs to be left on the effected areas for some period of time so I applied it at night.  I did not find that it had any effect in any positive or negative way over the period I applied it.	I was asked by the prescribing doctor to apply the ointment once a day to the affected areas (the back of both of my hands).  This was the entire process and I was to report back to him within a period of approximately six months.  This was a rather experimental treatment.  I applied the product as instructed but did not notice any repigmentation during the time I applied it (around 3 months).  I subsequently was advised by the doctor that I needed to continue the application, for a total period of at least six months

No benefits were identified because I could not take take  the medicine long enough to get a second  cholesterol test to measure for measuring any decrease in my cholesterol levels.  After having side effects, I did try to lower the dosage to 10m by cutting the pills in half, but still felt the bad effects.	At first, I did not associate my increasing tiredness and general lack of energy with the medicine. I just thought I was getting sick with a virus. Then, as time went on, I started to also experience muscle soreness and tightness.  By the time I started to think the way I was feeling might be related to the Lipitor, I realized, besides the physical symptoms,  I was in a state of depression.  As soon as I quit taking the pills, all the bad symptoms cleared.  A few days later, I tried taking less (half), but, again started feeling bad.	As previously stated, because my cholesterol levels were high, the doctor said I should take Lipitor for one month and then we would retest the cholesterol levels to see if the medicine was effective in lowering the levels. But, because I was unable to take the Lipitor for the entire month, the  second  cholesterol test was never taken.  After taking the Lipitor for about 10 days, I stopped taking it.  A few days later, I did try to take just half a pill.  But within days, the side effects started to return.

Side effects were peeling and some redness, but only occurred the time that i used too much Differin.

Treatment includes adding only about 1/3 pea sized amount to my chin area and the same amount to my forehead after cleansing at night.  This I do daily.

516	tenormin	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	an unknown ekg wave abnormality	Decreased nausea, dizziness when standing, pins and needles sensation. Eyes and Skin less sensitive to sunlight.	Extreme sleepiness (25mg feels like I took a Tylenol PM). Slight inability to concentrate. Depression of mood, slight irritability. I have noticed some suggest this is also prescribed for anxiety, I haven't noticed any reduction in anxiety, I have noticed if I'm irritated the irritability seems to last a bit longer than normal. It has done nothing to increase my motivation or productivity.	I already have a low heart rate, so an hour after taking it I always take 200mg caffeine + 2 Primatene tablets (25mg Ephedrine HCL) to raise heartbeat while the Atenolol stabilizes it. The Ephedrine also helps to counteract sleepiness and depressed mood Atenolol causes in my system. I was going to quit taking it but over 2 months I have slowly experienced an increase in my health, before I was almost bed-ridden, now I can get up and walk around for extended periods of time. I originally had a bad case of Mono a few years back and it still showed in my system, he said it probably caused a bad case of Chronic Fatigue but it is not considered a real medical condition, so he wrote me a script for Atenolol after my EKG. They took 6 EKG's that read no heartbeat and the 7th read a supposedly impossible wave, I did every test from two separate doctors, they have no idea what it is.
333	neurontin	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chonic pain	I did see improvement in numbness and tinglng in upper extremities. Helps marginally for sleep.	Poor concentration, drowsiness, dizziness, memory problems. My physian tried to titrate dose to 2400mg per day. The side effects were intolerable to the point that I was having prolems at work. I currently take 600mg hs.	I plan to discontinue this medication as the side effects are not worth the marginal benefit
845	ritalin	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	When I first began taking the Ritalin, I noticed a dramatic effect on my mood.  I felt wonderful!  I was energetic and positive and I felt that I could handle anything that came my way.  I don't want to sound as though I felt euphoric or manic - I just felt really GOOD about life.  However, after only a few days, that sense of confident well-being drained away.	Initially, the medication kept me awake all night but that only happened for a night or two.  I take them on an empty stomach in the morning and sometimes my hands shake very slightly for a while but it's not enough to cause any problems.	"""This medicine is doing it&#039;s job.  I actually fell asleep standing up in my dining room.  Hit my chin on the table (ouch). Now, I don&#039;t fall asleep at inappropriate times (after I take my  first dose).

904	paxil	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic attack	My anxiety when driving was lowered.		One day I was driving on a freeway (280, San Francisco Bay area) and felt like I was going to faint.  It was a clear day, not much traffic as it was the middle of the day and this freeway is more of a 'country' freeway than our main one, 101.  I pulled over to the shoulder so I could compose myself.  I felt like I was having a panic attack (which I had never had before but friends have) so I took deep, slow breaths to calm myself.  When I felt I was alright, I returned to the freeway but had to pull over once more before I reached home.  I have never been in an accident nor had this feeling before so could not rationalize what was happening. After it happened a few more times, I put paper bags in my car (for breathing) and started using side roads, where I had no problems.  When I went to my doctor, I told him about my anxiety and he prescribed Paxil for me.  I began taking it and, it took a while, though I wasn't ready to try the freeway right away, but it has definitely helped. I am now more willing to just get on the freeway.  I have not noticed any side effects from taking it or changes in my personality...I did not need it for depression or any other anxiety but freeway driving.

The infection had apparently grown over a period of several months and then reached a point that it suddenly was accute. I say it grew slowly over several months because my abdominal area, even as far up as including my waist, had grown from about 30 inches to about 33 inches and I required clothing two sizes larger. I had become more and more weak but thought that it was my age (even though up until a few months before the swelling started I was still hiking up to 10 or 11 miles a day in the Andes in Chili or in the Canadian Rockies.

I am taking probotics (460 mg each,6 billion total microorganisms per capsule twice daily), eating such as Activia daily, etc to try to repace the healthy bacteria level in my intestines but as stated earlier this is not yet accomplished.

I switched to paxil with constipation and I needed at least 10 hours of sleep to come out of it each morning. I switched to selexa with no effect.  I then tried zyprexa  which caused me to gain 10 lbs in a month, gave me memory loss and I started lactating again.  By then, they had come out with paxil-cr (extended release) and I have been on that ever since.

3425	tazorac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anti-aging	I used this drug as an alternative to Retin A. In that regards it worked admirably.  Retin A users have a period of almost 3 months where there skin (usually face) is tremendously red.  Tazorac has little of this.

As above, the drug has similar side effects to Retin-A, exept for the fact that they are far less frequent and far less severe.

It was like $10 with my insurance.  I would first wash my face with Neutogena deep facial cleaner.  After letting dry 30 minutes, I would start to apply the Tazorac.

It was very uncomfortable, even if I had the airconditioning on.  After several days, I started having muscle pains on both my legs.  I was losing sleep becasue I was so uncomfortable and could no longer tolerate taking the medicine.  My physician then gave me the option of trying a new medication, or sticking to Niaspan ER but at a reduced dose.  I chose to stay with the same drug but at a reduced dose.  I now taker 1500 milligrams daily and do not feel any side effects.  I still need to go back to my doctor to see how this change affected my Triglycerides.

While on Yasmin I experienced no weight gain or moodiness whatsoever. In addition to preventing pregnancy Yasmin helped to slightly decrease my anxiety levels without a feeling of mania or malaise as is often accompanied by the use of anti-depressants. The pill also seemed to help with breakouts associated with my monthly cycle.	I had to stop purchasing the drug because the cost was $60, even with a PPO insurance plan. It took six months for my cycle to re-acclimate after beginning the hormones.	Yasmin is a birth control pill I took once a day.

In the beginning it did spike my anxiety which I used a benzodiazepine to help with that until the anxiety calmed down. After that, I noticed I started to feel dizzy when I  stood up fast and it was another side effect. At this point I began to get nervous but I heard so much good reviews about this drug I really wanted it to work. After making it through my first month with it, the side effects began to lessen."""

3603	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti aging	The benefits I saw from Retin-A were considerable compared to non prescription skin care. The fine lines especially around my eyes and cheeks diminished and were not as deep. My entire skin tone looked younger, more even toned and my large pores were much less noticeable and more refined. My skin looked much healthier and it looked more soft focus. It took a few months to notice a measurable difference.	The main side effects I had while using Retin-A were drier,flaky skin.	When I started using Retin-A I started with the lower strength prescription to aviod side effects while my skin was acclimating to Retin-A. I started with Retin-A .025% strength every other night. After cleansing I wait 20 to 30 minutes and then apply the Retin-A. After another 30 minutes I apply a moisturizer if needed over the Retin-A. After about 2 months I switched to the next higher strength Retin-A which is .05%. I was much more senstive to this strength so I started using it once every 3 nights to start doing the same as above, waiting 20 to 30 minutes after cleansing to apply. Once my skin tolerated this routine after about a month without flakiness I went to every other night. I now can use Retin-A .05% every night but occasionally when I start to see any dryness or skin flaking I will skip a night to give my skin a rest. I love my results. Retin-A is the only skin care I've used where I have noticed a considerable difference in the amount of sun damage that has been repaired. My skin is much more healthy looking and more refined.

I also do not experience any bothersome toxicity or effectiveness problems as I generally would afford myself time-out days allowing my system a break from routines. I believe without this medication life would be greatly less enjoyable and my abilities to participate in a positive manner would be extremely limited.

134	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	herpes zoster	The medication stops the pain and puts an end to the condition if taken soon enough	I felt fatigued but this could be just a symptom of the condition.	I had little spots (blisters unbeknownst to me) on the side of my face which itched and burned terribly. This was about the size of a quarter.  I thought I had some sort of insect bite and just ignored it until it got worse and I felt so tired and sick that I went to the dr.  He took a culture but at that point he didn't think there was anything to test but prescribed Valtrex.  I took it immediately and within a day felt relief.  After a couple of days I felt a million times better.  I have had one or 2 re-occurances over the last 10 years and I make sure I always have Valtrex on hand just in case.  It is a terrible condition and I am thankful for Valtrex as it seems to stop it in its tracks.

This med suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat and have absolutely no desire for food if I don't eat. I can already tell that I've lost inches and pounds, but I haven't been on the scale to see exactly how much yet. I have only been exercising moderately, although the feeling of energy is incredible and makes me get up and do everything!!! My doctor was cautious in giving to me because of my high blood pressure, but fortunately my BP meds have my condition well under control, so I just keep track of my daily reading to ensure there are no spikes. I feel like this really works so far!	"I've read the side effects, but honestly, I can't say that I've experienced more than a couple of mild headaches and feeling that slight ""elated"" feeling. I already experience night sweats & some insomnia due to menopause, so I can't tell a difference in those categories."	I have a 30-day supply and based on what I've read about the addiction, I have not decided if I will continue beyond a 90-day regimen.

I eat pretty well and keep my weight within a healthy norm (fluctuates about 10 lbs over a year back and forth depending on how hard I try). Had good blood test results about a year ago - low blood pressure, everything within the normal range for my age.	The only side effects that I am aware of are the positive ones - keeping my skin from being overly dry, lack of menopausal symptoms (mostly). This patch has been a godsend for me, but I had my uterus removed in my 30s due to excessive bleeding, so I am not at risk for uterine cancer. There is no history of breast cancer in my immediate family (grandmothers/mother/sister)	Started out on a .1 mg patch and worked down to a .075 patch.... doc wanted me to go lower, but when I do I get some night sweats and can tell the difference so I am staying on the .075 = my hormone levels in my blood are normal for a woman my age on HRT.

To help me retain information that I was studing in school.  To help me stop putting things off that were important for me to finish.  To help improve my relationships.	I found that some of the side effects were very severe.  I would have compulsive sexual desires that I had never had before and wanted sex with my husband all the time.  I had great difficulty sleeping so I would take melatonin to go to sleep every night.  I would talk very fast as well as move fast.  I would have hand tremers.  I also had very dry mouth and diarrhea.	I woke up every morning a took 1 20mg tab with a full glass of water.  Then, throughout the day I would have to make myself drink water and eat.  I had lost all desire to eat or drink until around 8 or 9pm that day.  I would have obsessive thoughts and couldn't stop working on something until it was finished.  This meant even if I really needed to stop and do something else I couldn't.  I called my doctor and explained this and he switched me to adderall 10mg without extended release.  This has been much better.  However, I still have some obsessive behavor.  I have never been dx or tx for OCD.

But my skin did look much better so I continued on. But once the relationship ended (not caused by my low desire, btw) I decided to go off of it and get a cervical cap. My sex drive returned but so did my bad skin. I am now (8 years later) giving it another go with Apri, solely for my skin b/c I really like my cervical cap, which unfortunately they stopped making."

3423	tazorac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	wrinkles, brown spots	less noticable fine lines and blotchiness. skin appeared clearer and smoother. in addition skin appeared plumper. The brown spots would be less noticable as long as I was using the cream consistantly.	dry peeling skin, redness. once you stopped using it the blotchiness returned and brown spots returned. I needed to wear alot of sunscreen on my hand after using it on that area because it rendered those areas vulnerable to sun exposure. also while driving I had to wear gloves which blocked sun rays to my hands.	used from a tube mainly at night. Used a pea size amount on each hand and one pea size amount on the face. Used over the lip line and on fine lines under the eye.
1001	armour-thyroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hyhpothyroidism	weight loss, increased energy, better outlook on life, decreased anxiety, no longer have panic attacks, no longer feel depressed and in general feel happy and more content with life. My energy level has sky rocketed and my ability to be mentally focused is much better. My TSH went from 6.29 to .6. My T3 and T4 uptake are within the normal ranges.	I did not have any treatment side effects.	I went in for a routine check up and mentioned feeling tired and anxious and asked if I could have my hormone levels checked. It turned out that I had hypothyroidism. I was given a choice of Synthroid or Armour thyroid. Based on everything that I had read I wanted to try the Armour. I started on 30 mg. and after about 6 months increased to 45 mg. Every 3-6 months I've had blood work and my TSH level has steadily dropped each time to my current level of .6. I feel better than I have in years. The difference in my mental outlook and energy is incredible. I also avoid soy products, products with fluoride and wait about 2 hours before eating after I take my medicine because I have read that doing these things are beneficial in making the treatment more effective.
1422	adipex-p	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	weight loss	I have always tried to lose 20-30 pounds and had no luck.  A friend of mine used Adipex (Phentermine) and lost 40 pounds in 4 months so I had to try it.  I started taking it last October 08 and by Christmas I had to buy all new pants because my other ones were WAY too big.  Total I lost 25 pounds and am now 130. I just started taking it again after being off of it for 3 months because I didnt want to get too addicted which I know you can from this drug, and you also build up an immunity to it, which I also did. Overall though, it definitely works to loose weight, my sister-in-law, my best friend, and my sister all took it and my sister lost the least so far(only been on it for 1 month) with 15 pounds.	Bad trouble sleeping. WIll fall asleep after a little trouble, but cannot stay asleep, wake up several times a night unable to get good rest. Have to take sleep aide with this drug or wont sleep at all! Also have bad to mild headache for first week or so, goes away after a while.  Mood swings are absolutely noticable, ups and downs. I NEVER noticed where my appetite was decreased at all, actually makes my stomache growl about 1/2 hour after taking it, nor did I have any extra energy ever, although somehow I DID lose weight on this pill.	"""I have taken Adipex before a little over a year ago and lost 10 pounds the first 2 weeks, then I stopped taking it.  I just recently started taking again on November 5th, and it really curves my appetite, and makes me drink lots of water due to dry mouth. I haven&#039;t started working out yet, but I try to only eat fruit for breakfast, a &quot;smart one&quot; for lunch and a 100 calorie snack during the day if I&#039;m hungry. For supper I eat normal foods, just smaller portions, and drink nothing but water.  I have already noticed a difference in the way my clothes fit, but I&#039;m not going to weigh for another 2 days.

3428	tazorac	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I noticed a significant improvement in my acne.	I had painfully dry, irritated, and red skin for several months, as well as higher susceptibility to sunburn and visibly peeling, flaky skin... those first few months were the worst period of treatment. After a while, however, all the symptoms except for the peeling skin and sun sensitivity diminished.	I applied a pea-sized amount of Tazorac cream once a night before bed, starting in my freshmen year in high school. I've been using Tazorac ever since (five years or so) because of the positive skin effects it's supposed to have.
2535	lamisil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	toe-nail fungus	Although it is essential to take the medication for the full 90 days, after one week I noticed that the skin on my affected foot was looking much better. I had years of tough, thick, dry, flaky skin on my heel and pads under my toes. As each week passed, this condition continued to improve. Almost from day one I did not experience any itchy toes or feet. At the end of the 90 days, I could see healthy nails growing up from the cuticle, although it will take several more months for the entire toe-nail on each affected toe to grow long enough that I can cut away the damaged nail.	"The first few days (maybe three)of taking the drug I was a bit headachy and then experienced some mild stomach upset. After that, I was fine with no further issues.
A positive side effect was that after the treatment was over I noticed that the skin on my legs was very smooth. Previously I had rough, scaly skin which I just thought was dry skin, though I could never rid myself of it. But I guess it was part of the whole problem because now the skin is beautiful."	"""works great!"""
3662	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	mild to moderate depression	Improved mood after trying several other SSRI's. Had tried Prozac and Wellbutrin and got no effect from them. I was able to function better. I was not ecstatic, but was functional and less prone to negative thinking.	a bit of feeling dull or neutral.	Maximum dosage indicated in literature is 150 mg per day.  Took two 75 mg capsules in the morning with breakfast. The medication started to work within two or three days.  However, it's expensive. I would not say that I am non-functional without it, but I believe I am more functional when taking it.
3644	retin-a	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne/dull skin	Cleared up my acne and brightened my skin overall; slightly reduced fine lines.  Aside from acne, it seemed to help my skin in general.  This is by far the best acne treatment I've used.  Now I use it for overall skin appearance (not just for acne).	"Thinning of skin leaves more sun sensitivity. Also, it cleared my acne, but didn't seem to ""treat"" it - if I stop using it, my acne comes back within a few weeks."	Very easy - simply applied a pea-sized amount every other night before bed.
921	paxil	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	panic attacks	I have been on Paxil or generics for 9 years after a life-time of panic attacks. My attacks subsided immediately and though they recur every so often the relief has been a godsend. Even as a highly-productive and involved person it has been a lifetime of quiet fear that at any moment I would have these horrific feelings of losing my self and being depersonalized out of my body. As a few others have noted, the most common location for instant attacks is while driving. Paxil has calmed much of my life-long anxiety. I am a calmer and more socially comfortable person.	Lots of side effects, none of them deal breakers. It took months to achieve orgasm - it was like having a dead weight between my legs. Having reduced treatment to 10mgs a few years ago that has improved. As many others report, wild dreams and less deep sleep is now the norm but I have long grown accustomed to it. Miss a dose and you get those weird 'electric' buzz shocls in your brain - a tad alarming but not horrible. Weight increase of about 10 pounds - very difficult to get rid of.	Started at 10 mg on doctor's recommendation, went to 20 after a month. Noticable improvement in mood and lessened anxiety. After 4-5 years weaned myself down to 10 mg by cutting the pills. With doctor ok have stayed at 210 for the last 6 years. Once i tried to reduce it to 5 mg - big mistake. Too big a jump and had terrible anxiety. Decided I could live with 10 mg. It works, but with side effects. Like all powerful medicine, it's a tradeoff. For me it is still worth it 10 years later.
4069	mobic	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	It seemed to help with the joint inflamation. Some swelling of ankles was reduced and I didn't seem as achey. I tried several sample medications first like celebrex but I liked the Mobic best. I have not gone off of it since I started to really know if it makes a difference.	none	Took one 30mg tab a day.

It regulated my periods and made them short and light, cleared up my acne, and has effectively prevented pregnancy.

I&#039;m trying out a new birth control to try and get the headaches under control, but if I don&#039;t respond well to it, I&#039;m happy to go back to Nuvaring and Advil. I&#039;d recommend it to anyone."""

636	seasonique	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	to prevent pregnancy	4 periods a year	The first week that I took this pill, I felt like I had the flu.  I had to take a sick day off from work because I felt so sick: headache, constantly feeling hot and cold, extreme tiredness.  I also started breaking out a lot and my skin started to be so dry.  My husband also has said that I've had some mood swings as well.	"I stopped taking the pills today.  I hope this will stop all the symptoms.  I will probably never take any birth control for the rest of my life.  I was on Depo for about 2 years, which was fine--no major side effects except for the decreased sex drive.  I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen for about a year before Depo, but I stopped because I definitely got lighter periods but the periods were longer (5 days) than when I was not on any BC (3 days).
I shouldn't have been on any BC to begin with.  Afterall, I shouldn't complain--my periods are always on time like clock work.  No cramps, only the occasional bloating.  I started to be on BC to prevent pregnancy, but I'll just be more careful by using a condom instead."

So i can't really say there were any benefits to it, because eventough it helped with the wrist pain, the headaches were worse.	see above	This was prescribed by a physical therapist. I was also receiving the physical therapy for my wrist pain, which was from work related injury.(repetitive overuse). The pain killer was to help with the pain from just moving my hands.
1747	topamax	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/binge eating	With the Topamax alone, and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising, I lost about 10% of my body weight in the first two months of treatment. It was like a tiny switch in my brain was flipped and I just didn't crave gargantuan massive quantities of horrible-for-you food. Not that food didn't taste good, or I wasn't hungry, I just filled up really quickly, and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. So when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat, you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. Combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up, and there you have your weight loss.	Dry mouth (I was also taking Prozac at the time which definitely contributed), mild transient tingling in the hands and feet (pins and needles), I've read a lot of posts in forums online from people suffering memory problems with Topamax (i.e. dopamax), they forget words easily, have trouble spelling, feel foggy, etc... I guess I'm one of the few fortunate people whom Topamax doesn't effect that way. Either that, or the dose I'm at (200 mg) is well below my tolerance threshold. Many of the people in these forums were being treated for epilepsy and debilitating migraines and taking doses up to 1200mg.	I had done some research on Topamax online before it was even an approved treatment for migraines, and it was only FDA approved for epilepsy. While on the web I found that a surprising amount of doctors were prescribing it for off-label purposes, such as an add-on to an SSRI that wasn't working well enough in depressed patients, a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder, and (gasp!) a weight loss drug in obese patients and in those with binge eating disorder. Several convincing clinical studies have been done in all of the above categories as well. Topamax will have clearance from the FDA to be marketed for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 2010.

If I could tell I was going to have a hard time sleeping, I was supposed to take the medecine about 45 minutes before going to bed.  Sometimes it was hard to realize/remember to take it ahead of time like that, but it was so fast-acting that wasn't really a problem.  I'm little, 5'2 and 120 lbs, and the doctor said it was okay to break them in half so I mostly did.  After about fifteen minutes I would get drowsy and then I would get a nice night's sleep.   This was incredibly valuable and it was no problem to go off the medication at the end of treatment because I was only taking it when I needed it anyway, only a couple times a week at the worst point.  The halitosis might have actually made it easier to stop taking--I had to really want the sleep and be willing to put up with the foul taste in my mouth.

My skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter.	luckily I did not notice any negative side effects. The positive effects that I noticed out weighed the negative ones. The side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. The burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. I believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more I used it.	My treatment details are as follows: I Used Avita (Tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. So every morning before leaving the house I made sure to apply a sunscreen.

In addition there were emotional disturbances."	The drug was prescribed by a Cardiologist and was effective, however the side effects were considerable. After approximately one year the cholesterol LDL did drop and although this was positive, the side effects continued. After two years, the dosage was reduced to alternative days at the same daily dose. If the cholesterol level remains normal, with the adjustment of diet and exercise, the plan is to further reduce the drug over time.

I recently have suffered from major depressive disorder and was put on what was supposed to be the best of the best Lexapro. After a year I still saw no difference except for the lack of sex and asked my psychiatrist to switch me to Remeron.

They were physically embarassing and I could not even wear sheer pantyhose. The surgery would eliminate pain and the ugliness.   I was told to take the drug before surgery to minimize swelling and to minimize pain. I do not like to introduce drugs into my body unless an emergency so I did not take it before the surgery, instead opting for Bromelain enzyme, ginger and tumeric to reduce swelling.	The side effects after the surgery were swelling and pain and possibly infection at the incision sites. About 10 hours post surgery, the pain became unbearable, and I decided to take one dose of acetaminophen w/codeine #3.  When I got up a couple of hours later to go and use the bathroom, I passed out in the bathroom. Lucky for me, my husband was nearby.

My pain is significantly reduced because of these two medications, though not completely gone.  The side effects, to my knowledge, have been minimal, especially compared to what it could be without these medications.  Could a different medication work better?  Maybe.	It's hard to say what the side effects might be.  I sometimes have trouble thinking or speaking my thoughts concisely, moodiness, somewhat depressed, shortness of breath at times, dizziness, occasional vision problems, some numbness or odd sensations in legs or arms etc.  However, I can't say for sure if any of these side effects/symptoms are from taking Neurontin, the lidoderm patch or for some other reason (stresses...).

I took it in the morning, and it generally seemed to energize me enough so that I stayed active, and if it didn't relieve the pain, It seemed to keep me from thinking about it and I remained busy.	I did find that if I took it in the late afternoon, I really   couldn't sleep at night, mymind raed and I felt unsettled.   It reduced my appetite a bit, ad I would work without eating, or drinking.  Had to remind myself to eat.	I have degenerative joint desease in both my hands.  Took the standrd painkillers, not narcotics, but asa, tylenol, motrin, and then Celebrex.  The best was celebrex, but there is a danger with taking it long term.  Ultram ws prescribed at first as 50mg twice a day.  This wasn't at all effective.  So we upped the dose, and this worked well, except not at night. Since then I hae had boththumb joints replaced, and althoughI still have a prescription for the Ultram, I rarely use it... sometimes for back aches.  Someone once told me it is an opiate derivative.  If so, it does not seem to have an addictive quality, or any withdrawal symptoms, at least not the way I have used it.
1266	provigil	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	daytime sleepiness	Virtually nil. PLEASE< PLEASE read on....	"If you take a look at the side effects the FDA requires Provigil manufacturer Cephalon to list, you will find the usual stomach aches, headaches etc.. Such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don't bother reading the side effect profile for meds. However, failing to look at the side effects for Provigil could end up costing you your life. Provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  Further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of Provigil's side you are not likely to know what it means. The side effect is called ""vasodilatation"", and the manufacturer reported to the FDA that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. What is ""vasodilatation""?  Vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable ""vasodilation"", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  And, if you'll read on, you'll see why for me, and potentially for 1 out of every 50 users of Provigil, it very nearly killed me.  

After 7 weeks on Provigil, with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day, I awoke one morning in a highly delusional state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and I were seated. After apparently collapsing in my bedroom, I was taken to ER, which quickly determined that I was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). I quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. Even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an ER,  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. Those who survive likely do so, as I did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy CPR session."	"My ER doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. Arriving quickly, he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regional heart center 35 miles away. As he awaited the ambulance, he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab, not to put a stent in, but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destination next to my aorta, after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. The balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart, then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additional falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. Arriving at the heart center I was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for 9 days, kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs (""I'm in"", the TV doctors always say when the get the insertion right)."

So even under stressful life events which usually results with a breakout the Valtrax stopped or reduced the frequency of breakouts. So far I have only been taking 1 per day and I have not had any breakouts for a month.	It initially made me feel tired and lethargic. I believe it contributed to  a short bout of stomach upset and heavy bowel movements however this problem subsided fairly quickly. I think it also contributes to my eyes feeling dryer than usual. Since I am post menopausal dry eyes is a huge problem.	"""I had a terrible  out break. My chin felt red and swollen. I had sores and pus really bad. As soon as it was healed I would break out again. This lasted for six months. I had been to my family doctor  and several dermatologists, finally I met with a dermatologist  who prescribed valtrex. What a life saver. With school starting again Monday I was stressing out . I could feel my chin start to swell and so I decided to get a refill and try it. It worked! Yesterday my chin felt swollen  and sore and I was starting  to get red bumps under my bottom  lip. I took 2 in the afternoon  and 2 more when I went  to  bed  and this morning  it seems to be gone!

My mouth is so dry that I drink non-stop and cough a lot. What made me decide to quit this drug before the month trial is the fact that I have this really bad memory loss.

2428	synthroid	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	low thyroid	The synthroid medication did, for most of the ten years while I took it, keep my thyroid levels where they were supposed to be.	After taking this synthroid medication for a period of about 10 years, here is what happened.  We were on vacation in another state and all of a sudden I began to feel extremely horrible-- very weak, with a rapid heart beat.  We were getting ready to get on an airplane and come home.  So I thought if I can just get to my home town and get to a hospital, they can surely figure out what is wrong with me.  We arrived at our home airport and then we went straight to the emergency room, where they ran several tests and I was there for several hours, but they could find nothing wrong with me.  So they told me to go to my regular doctor the next day, which I did of course and he ran a blood test and found that it was the thyroid medication that was causing my problems.	"I was able to find an osteopathic doctor who put me on a natural thyroid, not a synthetic, he calld it a dessicated thyroid which came from an animal source, so I was able to get off the synthetic.  Then after being on that for a while, he was able to get me off of that and I took a natural supplement, L- tyrosine 
It was wonderful to get off of a prescription medication.  I hope this information may be helpful to someone out there."

2872	avita	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The benefits of using Tretinoin were great. First of all I noticed that my skin started glowing and my acne diminished greatly. But I had to be very patient because the results were not immediate. Continued use of the medicine rendered amazing results. My skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter.	luckily I did not notice any negative side effects. The positive effects that I noticed out weighed the negative ones. The side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. The burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. I believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more I used it.	My treatment details are as follows: I Used Avita (Tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. So every morning before leaving the house I made sure to apply a sunscreen.

I use it sparingly, only when I really need it, (about 2-3 times a week ) and I have not found it to be addictive at all. I actually find it to be relatively mild, and I think it's over-regulated.	I don't have any side effects from taking it.	"""I&#039;ve suffered with Meniere&#039;s/vestibular neuritis for over 37 years and it has cast a dark shadow over my quality of life.

In the 90's my Mom started using Retin-A to control this and apparently it worked well, so I tried it (her prescription) as a teenager and it just irritated my face , making it red and eventually flaky.  The drug is certainly powerful.  I am sure I would have benefited from continued use but I didn't.  Now, approaching 30, I still have some acne and am starting to think any acne whatsoever is unacceptable.  Reviewing options, Retin-A seems top on the list.  I have read that retinol is a distant second.  However, I am hesitant because of the inevitable initial irritation and flakyness associated with Retin-A.	see above	see above

Although steroids are being scrutinized in the media at this time, they do have a place in the treatment of life threatening episodes of asthma and other diseases that casue severe inflammation.  I do not care to be on prednisone for any period of time, however, breathing is necessary to life and the prednisone offers a quick relief of the symptoms.	While taking the prednisone I had an increase in blood pressure.  I also was very perspired while the dose was higher and felt extremely edgy and agitated.

I have fibromyalgia, and was having a hard time with the high fatigue levels and difficulty concentrating.

Even his teachers were very impressed with the difference, and my son's confidence improved tremendously.	The side effects have been very mild. At some points he seems more argumentative and high strung, but not most of the time.  Generally this medication has been well tolerated.  We do not administer the medication on the weekends or when he is not at school (during school breaks or during the summer).	"""My doctor originally put me on this medication because I thought I was ADD on account of concentration and focus issues.

I had tried many herbal sleep remedies, homeopathics, melatonin supplements, acupuncture and so forth, but the Serax was the only thing that helped me.  Initially during treatment I would be able to sleep 4-6 hours which was a huge benefit to me as I was exhausted from insomnia and stress.	Sometimes I would feel a slight tension in my head the next morning, but this was better than total exhaustion from sleeplessness.  More recently I find that on the rare occasions that I use Serax, I wake up with a headache if I take a full capsule.  I find using a half a capsule seems to work fine without giving me a headache.

154	zomig	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	The benefits of taking Zomig are suppression of migraine/headache pain for at least 12-24 hours.  Sometimes the migraine would return after this time but usually it went away completely until the next attack.	The side effects of taking Zomig for me are inability to wake (if taken before sleeping) and extreme drowsiness/fogginess if taken while remaining awake.	"I can take Zomig to alleviate any headache pain (including hangovers) which is odd because my doctor told me it would only work on migraines.  The sooner I  take it the faster it works.  If I take it and lie down in a dark room it works faster but I have a very difficult time waking up unless a full night has passed.  If I take it during the day and have to be at work it takes much longer to work (around three hours).  It also makes me feel very foggy and I cannot drive. Sometimes I have to take a second dose, but it has always worked after that.  Sometimes if I catch the headache early enough and go to bed I can cut the dose in half and it still works.  It's success seems to be closely tied to the ability to get away from light, sounds and smells that tend to aggrivate the migraine. If I wait too long to take it, nausea sets in and I cannot keep the medication down.  Then I need to take the sublingual dose, which I don't like to purchase because I can't divide the doses at all.  
I am very happy to have a medicine that alleviates the extreme migraine pain but I wish it didn't make me so drowsy because that still cuts into my productivity."

By that I mean that I do not suffer from the peaks and valleys of typical bi-polar disorder. I no longer have manic episodes for days and then sink into a dark depression. It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away.	The side effects are: dry mouth, possible headache,	"""Geodon has been a life saver.  It took awhile to get the right dose and know when to take it (AM versus PM), but I am doing great now.  I take it in the evening and still have morning grogginess after several months.  My doctor prescribed Provigil which really helps (although costly).  I take the Geodon in conjunction with Lamictal.  I have less agitation and find (at least my family finds) that I am much less hostile than before.  Do be careful in the heat as I got very sick from overheating and follow instructions and do not drink alcohol.  One pina colada felt like a whole case of beer."""
245	wellbutrin-xl	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety and depression	The best , BEST thing about Wellbutrin is that I have my sex drive back fully and I am realizing how much I missed it. That has been fantastic. I have noticed some appetite suppression too, which seems to sort of come and go, but it's definitely a welcome side effect. I have been able to get A LOT done at work, which is never a bad thing, but it's also unpredictable thus far. I also enjoy not having to deal with the nausea and overall sickness I would experience if I missed a dose of Zoloft.	I'm still sorting out the side effects. I keep having waves of anxiety and depression interspersed with days of feeling great. I have noticed I'm more quick to anger, which isn't really all that bad. Makes me realize I'm FEELING things fully. I have had some difficulty sleeping and loss of appetite, sometimes good, sometimes a little alarming.	I decided that I wanted to go off Zoloft because, while on it, I still experienced some depressive episodes and a terrible loss of libido. I felt out of control and wanted to reclaim that part of myself so I tapered slowly off of Zoloft... which was very difficult, as it can make one very very sick, with flu-like symptoms. While tapering off I began taking the 150 mg dose of Wellbutrin. I still don't feel 100% treated, if one ever can, but I am happy to have myself back, even if I'm not always as good as I want to be!

Prior to Provigil I was prescribed Adderall XR 20 mg. which really had a negative effect on my duty performance. I had TOO much energy and jitters and could not focus on anything for more than 5 minutes. The opposite of what it was prescribed for.	I began having stomach troubles with this drug. I now take Prilosec and Pepcid to counter this. Worth it? Sometimes. Like other reviews here, I found that the positive effects did wear off by the end of the day and dosing again is not smart if you want to get any sleep at all. In addition, I notice increased heart rate at times and seems to exacerbate the frequency and strength of my PVCs.

Clenching his fists, growling, hitting his sister and pulling her hair and being totally uncooperative were our everyday behaviors.  He is normally a laid back, sweet child.  The pediatrition disagrees and says it wasn't the medicine, but I know it was.	He was supposed to take it for 10 days, but the behavior was out of control, so the pediatrition told me to stop it for 24 hours and see if the behavior changed.  I stopped on day 7 and within 18 hours, he started to improve- within 24 hours he was almost back to normal.  The pediatrition and pharmacist both say that it doesn't go to the brain, and therefore can't cause behavior changes, but SOMETHING in that drug definitely effected him.

This medication does not seem to mix well with alcohol - memory loss and increased intoxication were experienced when alcohol was consumed. If a dosage was missed, side effects included unpleasant sensory experiences (like electrical sparks, ""zapping""), dizziness, and disorientation. A strong cautionary statement: withdrawal from this medication may be extremely unpleasant. The overall experience I had with this drug was diminished only by the harsh symptoms associated with discontinuing the drug. The effects included heightened irritability, and strong sensory effects described previously. The drug dosage should be tapered; I quit taking the drug ""cold turkey"" and in retrospect it was a poor choice.

Previously he was always tired during the day, after he started taking the nasonex continuously, as directed, he felt more energetic, and had many less headaches, too.	At first, the nasal spray was a little irritating to the nose, and he would sneeze after the administration. He just didn't like the spray into his nose.

2614	adderall-xr	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	add management	This does actually help calm you down and help you concentrate. My grades went upby a lot. I was calm and was doing much better on it (much better reffering to the ADD treatment) but there are so many negative side effects. In a way I regret ever taking it.	I developed an anorexia, I stopped eating and lost so much weight. I'm about 5ft. 6 now and weigh about 130 LBS. which is really skinny for my age and height. If I wouldn't have stopped I would be skin and bones. I got to a point where I lost color and I'm now way too skinny. Another side effect that I developed is insomnia. I have a VERY hard time sleeping. I can't fall asleep until about 1:00 and that's every night. It's horrible. Another side effect that's very serious, is development of depression. I had to go on anti-depressants because of the drug about 3 months after using adderall. It depresses you so much. After school I'd get home and be so depressed. I'd cry and just feel so misserable. I was seriously depressed. A fact that everyone should understand about adderall is that it's in a way a wattered down version of meth. The side effects are the same but not as severe. But it's still bad. It will mess up your teeth by giving you a VERY dry mouth, your weight and most of all your brain chemistry. I went from ADD to depression to now ADHD. I'm going back on stimulant drugs like adderall when school starts. I don't know how it'll work out because I now have a tolerance to it. And I'm getting new treatment. I don't know what'll happen or anything. But I just wantto get through school. Anyone that will be perscribbed to this should research on it and get the facts. Research for a long time. Not just one article reading. Get as much info as possible. The side effects are so severe that you should really know what you're exposing yourself to. They're all horrible. Especially the addiction that you get to it. I'm addicted to it and can't stop craving it. I feel like I need it so bad. It's been months and still I want it extremely bad. Be careful what choice you make. It gets the job done. Hut will screw up your life. This is just my experience. It may be different for you but still do your research.	I was on 20 MGS for a while then went up to 40 then more and went back down to 25.

"Doctor hoped to wean me off of Xanax by using Effexor as what she called a ""non-addictive"" substitute. Unfortunately, I needed increasing doses of Xanax to counteract some of the side effects of the Effexor.

I noticed a small difference in skin smoothness but my skin was very dry.  I began using it with Revale Skin which is made from the Coffeeberry and noticed that my skin was much more hydrated and my fine lines and wrinkles began to improve.

I no longer have any stiffness, except for when its cold or if I grip something for a while, but it doesn't last for hours like it used to.  The swelling in my joints has signficantly decreased.  Unfortunately, the medicine has not stopped my flare-ups, which only last for a 2-4mnths at a time on a finger joint or toe joint.  Nor has it prevented osteoarthritis in my feet.  I am also struggling to find that right dose that helps with the fatigue.	I got pneumonia after the first treatment and it took 3 months for it to go away.  My breathing hasn't been the same since, I've to see a pulmonary specialist every couple months to manage the constant asthma that I now have.  I have also gained approx 25 while taking the medicine, although it's not supposed to be a side-effect.  This is what bothers me most, extra weight puts more strain in my joints.

"Some drowsiness at night after taken it throughout the day and some constipation. However after taking it for only two weeks I had a seizure that sent me to hospital and was told by doc there that elavil and tramadol combined can cause seizures! NO ONE told me this.

The two meds were prescribed to me by the same physician and I understand oversights can happen. However if I had known from beginning that seizures might be a possibility I would asked for something else.

The only side effect that I had was strange dreams for the first few nights.	Every day you are to take Chantix once in the morning and once at night, and set a date to stop smoking. That is what I did, and I set my date at ten days after I starting taking the medication. In less time than ten days, I was not reaching for a cigarette with my morning coffee. I stopped smoking all together in two weeks, but took the medication for four months. When family and friends that are smokers would come over, I would want to smoke with them. I restarted the program twice, then told myself I would just have to NOT smoke with them.

I did have slight skin irritation during the first 2 weeks of use and after the second week I started having a few acne cysts (which is apparently a normal skin reaction during the first weeks of treatment). Nevertheless, I asked my doctor to put me on minocycline in order to avoid additional acne scars. This combination (Retin-A-Micro & Mincycline) works wonders!	I apply a thin layer of retin-a-micro gel every night after cleansing on my face and onto the acne prone areas on the chest. In order to avoid skin irritation, I used as little gel as possible during the first weeks. I think this is why I had only minor side effects. My skin has started to be used to the medication and I therefore can now use a bit more (though still a thin layer).

It has not made me as tired or hungry as other meds have which was a welcome surprise.  Still not able to focus as well as I had hoped.  I work full-time and hold an aditional part-time job and was worried that I was not going to be able to continue with these prior to beginning with this treatment.  I have been managing better since taking the lithium.	Blurry vision to the point where I now have to wear glasses.  My skin has acne and I didn't have it before.  I have to use a prescription to controle it.  My acid reflux is terrible and i have to use a prevacid to control that.

My hair falls out more than it used to.  As my doctor says: it's a dirty drug.  However, I'm not a zombie and I can sleep so I can learn to live with the above.	I started at 150mg and slowly went up by 150mg every time the side effects calmed down.  Usually when I stopped tasting the metallic taste in my mouth I would increase the dose.

1432	tirosint	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	It seemed to stabilize my metabolism.	I didn't seem to see any and was frequently not sure if I was actually getting the right dose.  It took about 3 years to get the current dose right.  And since that time I haven't changed it.  I have found out that the dosage I am taking is the very least amount I can take and still take thyroid medicine.	I take one thyroid pill a day.  I did originally take Synthyroid, but changed to the generic brand about 5 years ago to save on total costs.  Since I have been on generic brands, the shape of the pill has changed.  Also, so has the directions on taking it.  Now I can hardly take it and have it be effective, because I have to take the pill on an empty stomach, with a full glass of water, in the morning, and I can't have anything that might interfere with its absorption for 4 hours -- such as food, vitamins, or any other medicine.  So I do not know if it is effective or not, since I would have to try and take it in the middle of the night.  I am not going to do that, so I take it at night before going to sleep --- without a full glass of water.
290	panixine-disperdose	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I had severe acne for many years and I was sort of living with it without seeking cures seriously. I tried a couple of other anti-biotics before but not very diligently. I started to be more disciplined and actually took Keflex every day. In the beginning I was also taking Apri the birth control pill. I took both for a couple of months and my face started to be better in a week or two and completely cleared in a couple of months - which made me so much happier with my life. Then I stop Apri, and I continued with Keflex. And it seems that if I stop Keflex, my acne will come back a little. So I have not tried stoping Keflex for more than a week or two. I am a little concerned with the long term side effects of Keflex although I am not sure whether there should be any. I think I will continue taking Keflex and I will also ask my docotor to test blood or any other things that I should be cautious of.	It is hard to say. I have chronic headaches and general stress. So I am not sure whether the Keflex may have made matters a bit worse sometimes. Overall, I can't seem to correlate Keflex to my other conditions at all.	...
3136	malarone	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	malaria prevention	The benefits if I had continued to take the Malarone for the entire two weeks would have been to not contract Malaria.

Nausea was constant even when the drug was taken separate from other drugs and with food/on a full stomach etc.  I felt almost flu like; ie the beginning of flu onset when you are not yet fully sick.	"""Be advised that any medication can have averse reactions on anybody. My experience with Malarone was when I traveled to Cambodia for 2 weekw. It took about a day before it started but Malarone completely incapacitated me with a constant level of nausea. I could not eat nor was it worth leaving the hotel because I was weakened by it. l, too, had to discontinue its use for the entire trip, completely soaked in deet instead.

However, after about six months, my urinary habits returned to pre-medication levels.  I void every two hours.  About one year ago, I stopped taking Detrol LA for two months, thinking that giving my bladder a break from the med would help.  I then restarted Detrol LA and noticed no difference.  I am seriously thinking about stopping the medication.  It is essentially useless.	Mild dry mouth.  Otherwise, no side effects.	I have been on Detrol LA for since being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis two years ago.  I have a spastic bladder and urinate every two hours.  I take 2mg twice a day.

I actually had to hold a vomit bag while I sat on the couch, and car rides were pretty impossible from motion sickness. But that passed pretty quickly.	I began on 50mg, after growing absolutely sick of feeling terrible all the time. I went on this for about six months, with little difference in my moods. After a suicide attempt (overdose on Trazodone; I no longer take this medication), I was put into a psychiatric ward for a week and my dosage was doubled from 50mg to 100mg, which was one of the best things to ever happen to me.

The vicodin doesn't seem to be a problem with side effects as long as I don't take more than one tablet at a time (500/5).	I've had depression and pain for some time.  They have both caused serious problems in my life.  I found myself isolated and sleeping far too much.  I did some research and found that lack of seritonin could cause an increse sensitivity to pain so I was hoping that my pain would subside with this treatment.  So far, I can't tell the difference.

1726	advair-hfa	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma/allergies	Overall, the benefits have been very good.  A rescue inhaler hasn't been used in more than a year, nor has there been a severe asthma attack.  During the period there may have been three incidences where it seemed like an attack was coming on (curing exertion and cold, damp weather) but simply a better environment and a couple of cups of coffee warded it off.  There are times of wheezy, heavy-chestedness, but these are minimal in comparison to prior to taking Advair.	Wallet shock.  Patient seems to overall fall asleep easier, but tends to have some problems getting a deep sleep, but this may or may not be related to the Advair.  Other than that, there do not seem to be any adverse side effects  -- casually or medically -- after about 1-1/2 years of taking the medication.	The patient developed asthma four years ago.  It was controlled on an 'attack' basis, generally with an OTC inhaler.  When most OTC inhalers were taken off the market prior to reformulation, and a severe asthma attack, a prescription inhaler was prescribed, but it was being used more often than should, and did not alleviate the problems.  After a thorough examination, the doctor prescribed Advair, as directed with two puffs/inhales daily, morning and evening (at least 8 hours apart).  The patient is examined/tested every three months prior to refilling prescription to ensure there are no side-effects or adverse reactions.

317	ativan	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I have had problems falling asleep for many years. I had tried various other medicines, both over the counter and prescription, and nothing seemed to work - some didn't work at all, some helped me initially fall asleep but woke me up in the middle of the night, and others made me tired and feeling as if I were drugged the next morning. Then one day, my dentist prescribed one Ativan to take before bedtime the night before an extraction, and I actually fell asleep standing up! This is the first sleep medication that helps me initially fall asleep, sleep through the night, and doesn't make me feel tired the next day. Plus, it has the added benefit of helping to reduce my worry, anxiety, and stress that had always kept me from falling asleep before.	"One of the warnings on the bottle is ""May cause drowsiness"". Well, that's why I am taking it! If you don't want to feel drowsy, then Ativan is probably not for you. Another drawback is that if it is used too often, your body will get used to it and you may have to bump up your dose. When I first began taking Ativan, I only needed half a mg. to fall asleep, so I would cut a tablet in half. I only use it 3 or 4 times a month, but even at that dosage, after having used it for several years, I now find I have to take a whole tablet in order for the Ativan to help me sleep."	"""Hey Everyone, I take 2mg of Ativan a day. 1 mg in the morning and 1 mg at night before bed. I have been diagnosed with Severe Panic Attack and Depression. Lorazepam (Generic brand for Ativan) does help me. Understand that the effects for any medication is going to vary person to person. I don&#039;t get sleepy in the morning when I take it, but it does help me get a good night&#039;s sleep at night when I&#039;m tired. 

Also, I do want to say: Recently, my pharmacy didn&#039;t give me the exact amount of pills of Ativan, so I have been off of it &quot;cold turkey&quot; because I ran out and the withdrawal symptoms can be a hellish.

This drug was added as a preventative medication when migraines became so dibilitating that I could not function in everyday life, i.e., go to work, take care of self and family, etc.  Migraines were reduced after approximately 6-8 weeks on the medication to about 1 per month and then continually reduced to 1 every 3 to 6 months as I stayed on the medication.  I also use the medication to manage my mood disorder (bi-polar disorder) and was able to not have to take a mood stabalizer, because this drug also manages to keep me from getting ""manic"", so it is an extra ""bonus"" on top of the migraine management!!"	The only side effect I noticed was some weight loss in the beginning.  My doctor was very careful to start me out on 50 MG and move me up VERY slowly to the 200 MG 2x per day, which I understand is a very high dosage and took all of 4 years to get to that dosage.  I was monitored every 30 days to ensure that I was not losing too much weight, having any type of eye problems, or numbness in my hands or feet--the eye problems, and numbness I never experienced; but was always told that if I did experience even a hint of these things, that I would have to stop the medication immediately--so my doctor does constantly ask me about those things.  I have also read that Topamax has been used to treat alcoholics, and have noticed that since taking it, I have no desire to drink alcohol at all--but I am not an alcoholic--just a unique observation.  It really just seems like a great drug!!	"""I suffered a stroke in &#039;04 and my neurologist prescribed Neurontin to deal with the resulting numbness and tingling on the right side.

2729	elavil	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	The drug helped with sleep, but was inconsistent. I was a chronic insomniac, rarely sleeping more than 5 hours a night, often less.  With amitriptyline I was able to sleep more regularly (although not always), thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of depression and living more functionally on the whole.	Unfortunately, athough I was sleeping more regularly, I was still not rejuvenated.  The sleep was of a drugged quality, remarkably different from a natural sleep, in that I still felt tired a lot of the time.  Always dry mouth after the night, and after several years of use, I wondered if it had affected my memory, as loss of memory was notable. Seems to me that I had frequent headaches, as well.	I took the drug every night, just before I intended to sleep.  Often I would fall asleep, but still wake in the night, although usually falling asleep again, which I would not be able to do without the drug.  Mornings were a little foggy for me, and there was the reality of dry-mouth, and the possibility of a headache.  I tried to quit for several months after the second year, but was so plagued by insomnia that I went back on it.  After another 9 months or so, I quit because I was worried that the long term use had affected my memory and the efficacy of the drug was inconsistent in any case.

I've always had some sporadic adult acne flair ups from time to time, but it got much worse after I started using this nasal spray. I even started getting some pimples on my chest which I never had before.  I didn't know the Flonase was the cause until recently when I was looking up information on acne treatments online.

2255	patanol	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	eye allergies	I have seasonal allergies and especially in the spring and fall, my eyes itch and get dry.

In the end, I came off lyrica and immediately dropped 20 pounds and the nerve was no longer impinged.

I should mention that the med stopped working after only a very brief period, perhaps months. However my doctor continues to prescribe, why I don&#039;t know.  I rarely take it any more, but when I do, hoping for the same relief initially felt - nothing!!!
Only advise I can offer is; if it works for you, great BUT don&#039;t think it is the cure, at least not long term."""

Due to the rapid improvement of my condition following the first few doses of Amoxicillin I was able to return to work almost immediately.	There were no noticable side effects.  For the seven day period that I was taking the Amoxicillin caplets I did not feel 'normal' in that I felt light headed and somewhat disconnected.  However, I was still coughing with the chest infection and it was difficult to tell how much of what I was feeling was due to the infection and its after-effects and how much was due to the Amoxicillin.

My God, I'm amazed that this drug is still on the market. I'm actually an MD, and was prescribed this drug for anxiety and panic attacks.

Got leg spasms that night and woke up 12 hours post-ingestion having a rebound panic attack. When morning finally arrived, I had the kind of hangover headache that you get when you're in college and have spent the night parting and binge drinking, but without any of the fun. The next day, upon advice from my psychiatrist, I dropped the dose right down to 25 mg, with no change in side effects. 3rd day I tried only 6.25 mg (quarter of a 25 mg pill), and still felt nauseous, hot, dizzy and weak...and fell asleep for two hours. This is now day 6 and I'm finally recovering from my 3 day trip to hell with Effexor. Left a 5 min message on my psychiatrist's machine - will not be taking this crap anymore!! Will not EVER be prescribing this to any of my patients.	75 mg per day starting dose for anxiety and panic attacks.

I couldn&#039;t believe how fast it worked and how much better it made me feel, and I mean like in less than a week!  BUT the bad news for me, I had a rare side effect, the first one of my psychiatrists patients to ever get it and he had to look it up to confirm that it was being caused by the medication (although I knew it was for sure)... It made me go blind! I don&#039;t mean black out blind, but rather it made it so my pupils couldn&#039;t dilate and constrict properly so I couldn&#039;t focus my eyesight enough to even read anymore.  So, 10 days after starting it I stopped and luckily 3 days after stopping my eyes started to return to normal, but that freaked me out beyond belief!!! Worked great for depression."""
3635	retin-a	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne and wrinkles	It had a dramatic impact in terms of reducing how often I would break out. My skin was smoother and more clear.  And the fine lines around my eyes were reduced dramatically.	I would get some peeling or redness if I applied too much.  If this occurred, I would stop using it for a day or two, and the problem would go away.  It was more of a concern in the winter months when my skin was more dry.  But having oily skin, it usually wasn't a big problem.	I was told to use it at night.  If redness or peeling occurred, use it less frequently.
361	neurontin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	peripheral pain arms	Reduced pain and discomfort in both arms.  Calmer and less anxious personality. Pt enjoyed her life just a slight bit better and was able to participate in other various activities with her friends, family and to do art work that she loves at the day center where she attends two times a week.	Some mild dizziness initially.  Pt. reported light-headedness when getting up from a chair for a minute or two.  Side effects seem to have resolved, though maybe scattered thinking is slightly more increased.	Pt was initially prescribed neurontin 300mg; one pill in the morning and one pill in the afternoom then two pills at bedtime.  Patient then began to complain of increased pain in upper arms and shoulders after about two years total on the recently described dosages.  The doctor then increased the dose, starting with 300mg, two pills in the morning, then one pill of same at noon and the two pills, 300mg each at bedtime for four days.  After that it will be neurontin 300mg, two pills in the morning, then two pills at noon and two pills at bedtime.  This regeme just began yesterday, so results of such are not yet observable.
1991	vicodin	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	post-op pain	The treatment benefits of Vicodin (Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen) were relief of severe pain from surgical procedure.	The side effects included:  extreme dizziness, nausea, and disorientation.  Also experienced cold sweats.	Vicodin (Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen) was prescribed at one to two 500mg tablets every four to six hours.  The drug induced deep sleep, followed by restlessness, heavy nausea, and extremem dizziness.  Discontinued use of the drug after three days due to severity of side effects.
1446	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	fybromyalgia	for severe pain and acheness	none	I had severe pain from stiffness, achyness, nerve pain in the muscles in my whole body.  In the morning it would take me ten minutes to get from my bed to the bathroom and I would be crying all the way because of the pain.  Cymbalta is a miracle drug. When added to my other medications for pain it made all the difference in the world and I was able to function pretty normal. Thank God!

1474	cymbalta	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	It seemed to relax me, which reduced some of the muscle pain that I had been having.  It seemed to slightly reduce the nerve pain, but not enough to warrant taking it long-term.  Other than that, I did not notice benefits specific to my fibromyalgia symptoms.  It did seem to neutralize my feelings however.  I could not experience deep sadness.  So, I can see how it would help with people suffering from depression.	I experienced drowsiness in the first 1-2 weeks which went away.  At night, I experienced dry mouth and dry eyes, usually beginning about 8pm through bedtime.  I am a bit more drowsy in the morning.  It takes a bit longer to wake up completely in the morning.	"""I was prescribed Cymbalta for a combination of chronic pain from osteoarthritis and major depressive disorder with melancholia. I started with 30mg for the first two weeks, but had to stop taking my daily 1200 to 1800mg of ibuprofen and also quit drinking. For depression, it was amazing. I felt relief from my despondency within a handful of days, and that has continued through this, my third month. I had my dose increased to 60mg to try and get relief from the chronic pain, but it has not been effective for me in addressing that - thus my rating. For depression, I give it a 10, but for pain (my experience) I have to give it at best, a 3. After consulting with my doctor, he said I could resume taking ibuprofen at a much lower dose."""
783	naproxen	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	costochondritis/ inflammation of the chest wall	none	Nausea, loss of appetite, a little chest pain and vomiting. They gave me a shot of this at the hospital and then perscribed me with it. Once I got home I noticed I had an upset stomach, I thought it was because they gave me the shot on an empty stomach, so I ate something small and tried to take a nap. When I woke up from my nap my upset stomach did not go away and I felt naushes. I tried to drink a Powerade and eat a few preztles, that did not help at all. So for dinner I ate some soup and the upset stomach, nausea and chest pain still continued. I went to bed and woke up with stomach pains and still nausea. I ended up vomiting but only a little. I haven't taken any of the prescribed pills, just the shot at the hospital, and I am still feeling nausea, an upset stomach and a little chest pain. This medicine is not good at all.	"""I became very ill taking Aleve on a routine basis. I developed an intestinal ulcer, ringing in my ears, dizziness, vision changes the list goes on. """

However, about 5-6 hours after taking the pill, I get sleepy and groggy.  I have never taken a stimulant (newly diagnosed ADD), but this sounds familiar to the ""crash"" I hear people talking about.  So far the sleepiness and fatigue are out-weighing the benefits of this drug for me."	"See above.  Sleepiness and groggy-ness about 6 hours after dose.  I also feel irritable during the ""sleepy"" time, probably due to the fatigue factor.  I have noticed that little things get me irritated more easily while on Stattera."	"""For me this drug causede headaches everyday, nausea and gagging, and dry mouth all the time. I noticed a change in personality - easily agitated, I was &quot;distant&quot; and lost my &quot;affectionate side&quot;. My doctor made me come off it slowly before I started Concerta. Coming off it is just as bad."""
894	paxil	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	The treatment Benefits included feeling less anxiety, stress and pressure in many social situations. I felt less irritable and more willing and open for change. I had been feeling very down on myself and �lost� in terms of my emotional well being and stability. I had been feeling a lot of pressure and like I didn�t fit in in many situations. I also felt that many things in life were hard- even small things like showering or brushing my teeth. Taking this medication helped me to overcome those feelings and be able to do everyday things without seeing them as such a challenge. It stabilized my mood as well so I wasn�t experiencing major irritability, intense frustration or anger.	The Side effects I experienced from this drug were minimal. I did experience some headaches and a bit of a �spacey� feeling in the head when I first started taking it. Overall, I would say that the major issue I experienced which I am considering a side effect was a dulling of the emotions. While it helped me to curb my frustration and irritability, it also dulled my ability to feel great happiness or excitement about anything. My husband complained that I just stopped caring about everything. I also became completely disinterested in sex.	I am unsure of what the treatment details mean. I took this drug for about a year under the supervision of my general practioner. I took a 10 mg dosage the entire time. This dose was never increased. The drug took about 4 weeks before I noticed the benefits. I stopped taking the drug when I, along with my GP felt that I was doing better and no longer needed it.
3579	differin	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	reduced acne and refined skin texture. Helped to prevent new breakouts to a certain extent.	Dry skin. After washing even with the mildest cleansers I noticed my skin would be very tight and uncomforable.	"Differin is a retinoid, supposedly the mildest of all retinoids. I was prescribed this for mild, yet persistent acne. While it did help clear up the acne it also caused me to continue to get more pimples in areas I didnt normally get them. So it was a slight paradox. 

I would have continued to use the medication of it wasnt for the dryness and tighness I used to get after water touched my skin. My skin never felt comfortable. I gave it a good 5 months but my skin never seemed to adjust.

So while it worked pretty good for the acne, it also caused to much skin dryness. So I moved onto a new treatment method."

I started taking the Biaxin as pary of Prevpac.  In about 3 days, I noticed that the pain was lessening and I was feeling less run down. I had been ill due to the condition being undiagnosed for about 5 months. The infection was clearing up	After  taking the Biaxin for 9 days and feeling much improvement, I started noticing some itchy bumps on my legs.  Over the next 2 days, my whole body erupted into welts, especially in the axilla, the groin. I called my doctoe and stopped the Biaxin. I continued to have new hives each day for the next 5 days.  Gradually they went away.	To eliminate the side effects of hives, I had to stop the Biaxin and all other medication.  I ties taking Sudaphed to control the itching, but this was not effective.  I ended up going to the emergency room because the welst were so itchy and painful and I had not slept in 2 days.  They were unable to give me any medication for the reaction beacuse of my gastrointestinal distress.  I had to jus wait it out.

None that I am aware of.	I take Nexium once a day in the morning. If I have a flare up of acid reflux, I will take another at dinner time. The once a day regime generally controls my acid reflux quite well. On the rare occasions when I forget to take Nexium, reflux flares up immediately, so I have good evidence it is responsible for the symptom control.
3927	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Reduced the acid reflux and heartburn that was present in the late evening hours. Overall, Nexium relieved me of acid reflux and heartburn.	I did not experience side effects, although some people do.	I took a pill everyday (with water) about a hour before my dinner. I did not skip any days, but used everyday, so as to prevent heartburn rather than treat it.
1263	provigil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	multiple sclerosis	Provigil energizes me which improves my ability to function. Without it, the fatigue I experience due to MS overwhelms me and renders me pretty much useless.	The only side effect is increased wakefulness at night when I'd like to go to  sleep.	"""I&#039;m in the navy and it was very hard fighting my sleep for the first 5 years of being in I finally got a sleep study an they diagnosed me with narcolepsy. I don&#039;t really like taking medication for anything but my doctor introduced me to Provigil. I finally feel like a normal person, although the first month I had very bad headaches it slowly went away and I went from taking 1 100mg pill a day to 2 100mg pills. My body got used to it within the first 2mths. Overall I love this medicine. works pretty good for me."""

892	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	mild depression	I could see a dramatic difference in my mood within 3 weeks!  I felt interested in all my hobbies again plus I was smiling and laughing more.  My doctor told me I could be the poster child for Paxil.  This drug made a remarkable improvement in my mild depressive state.  I recently (5 wks ago) underwent gastric bypass surgery.  The doctor that performed this surgery told me not to quit taking Paxil...it would be like losing my best friend.  I have had absolutely no depression after my surgery (which I understand is not common).  This drug is amazing!	The only side effects I had were temporary decreased sexual desire and a decreased ability to have orgasms.  These side effects went away after about 6 months on this drug.	I take one 20 mg. pill once a day at the same time.  I usually take my pill first thing in the morning because it's easier for me to remember.  I did research on this product before I actually started taking it and found that the 20 mg. dose had the same results as the 40 mg. dose and showed no marked improvement.  The 20 mg. dose has been great for me.

I&#039;ve tried just about every acne treatment out there with no prevail. When I started my Retin-A (0.025) treatment 5 months ago I became really discouraged by my skins immediate discolouration, mostly red, and the flakiness it created. I came close a couple times to giving up, especially when my skin wasn&#039;t clearing up and how sore I was some days from the continuous use. But this past month has been the turn around. I feel I am finally out of the so called &#039;purge&#039; and my skin is becoming clear and smooth like it has been in past for short stints. The best advice I can give any user is to have patience. It&#039;s not an overnight fix, but the long term results are worth it."""
1657	clomid	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	infertility	Increased my estrogen levels, started ovulating again, and after about 6 months my ovulation formed a predictable pattern with an ending menstrual period. It was an easy small sized capsule to swallow and did not break down in water. Once ovulation was kicked off and preganancy still did not occur, it allowed my obstetrician to focus on other possible problems.	"Initially there were no problems, but after a week or so, began to suffer from blurred vision, which would appear and disappear at random. Hot flushes would also be sporadic. I also had a sense of ""scatterbrain"" ie my mind felt jumbled up, I could not make quick decisions, everything seemed blurry in my head. My stomach suffered from bloating  and a sense of squirmishness.  On some days I vomitted.Over time this decreased, and eventually after 1 and 1/2 years these symptons stopped. The time line probably could be reduced, but on ocassions of sickness, I stopped taking clomid and began the next month. My skin had a positive impact - it was very clear and had a very soft feel/texture. I had a very heightened sense of smell as well."	After a first successful pregnancy, my attempts at a second were not succeeding. Medical tests showed my ovulation hormones were very low and my period was very erratic and sometimes non existant. This coincides with my history of polycistic ovariaries. A dosage of Clomid was initiated with the aim of increasing hormones to correct levels, produsing measurable ovulation and resulting regular menstrual periods. Clomid caused some quite uncomfortable side effects initially ie dizziness, vomitting, unclear mental thoughts and stomach sensitivity, which onoccassons sent me to bed for recovery. Over time as my body absorbed clomid and adjusted to the hew level of hormones, the side effects stopped. Whilst not inducing a pregancy, it allowed my obstercian to focus on other possible problems. Overall, Clomid did exactly what it is designed to do - stimulate ovulation. I would recommend its use.

By day 5 I was hospitalized in intensive care.
351	neurontin	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	epilepsy, depression and pain	This medication was initially prescribed for pain management and was somewhat effective, but a new neurologist suggested incresing the dose as an addition to the anti-seizure medications that were not completely controlling my epilesy.  This addition finally got the seizures completely under control.	Sometimes I feel a bit nauseated if I take it with my other medications.	As I stated, increasing the dosage of this medication finally got my epilepsy under control.  I was originally prescribed this drug for pain management of a chronic pain problem, but in a lower dose. While I feel that is has only had a minimal effect of lmy pain, the higher dose has gotten my seizures under control.  I also suffer from depression and a panic disorder that may be helped from this drug, but I think that that may be true indirectly, as I think the elimination of the seizures has been the main cause of the relief, particularly the anxiety.
