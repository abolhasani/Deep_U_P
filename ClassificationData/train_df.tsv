It was imperative in my treatment, though, that the drug be NON GENERIC ONLY."	Dizziness	"""Side effects- over 5 years losing hair but I take it 3 times a day with other medication for Multiple Sclerosis."""
2096	renova	8	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	hyperpigmentation	Tretinoin, used in conjunction with the Obagi regimen, greatly reduced facial hyperpigmention which was due to hormones and sun damage.	Severe redness, burning and peeling occurred in the first 6-8 months of use, but gradually dissipated.	"Tretinoin (pea size) was blended on the back of the hand with an equal amount of Blender (#5 step in the Obagi system).  The mixture was then applied to the face, neck and chest avoiding the eyes and lips. The residual cream remaining on the hand was spread on the back of the hands to reduce ""age spots"".  No noticeable side effects were evident on the hands, but the procedure was effective.  Care was taken not to expose the treated areas to sunlight."
3179	desyrel	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	poor sleep quality	Able to sleep throughout the night without waking up, not groggy in the morning.	Dry mouth in the morning up on waking, dry eyes.	"""I have been on trazodone for about five years, ever since I was going through a nasty downward spiral due to my personal situation at the time and couldn&#039;t sleep for three days/nights in a row. 

The doctor who prescribed it for me was an &quot;old-time&quot; doc who wasn&#039;t into unnecessary medication (or any, most of the time) but saw there was a need that day with me. The fact that it was also an antidepressant was also a plus (but ultimately it wasn&#039;t effective enough on its own for that purpose). 

Taking trazodone at night (50mg) plus 1/2 a typical Ambien pill helps me sleep a good five or six hours straight--beats the way I used to sleep and thought was normal for most of my life; waking up every two or three hours."""
1214	prozac	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	serotonin imbalance, mood swings	Taking Prozac has enabled me to not erupt emotionally or lash out verbally at others during stressful situations, such as traffic jams, bad customer service, or when people are generally disrespecting me.  Most of the time, I have more patience than I did before taking the drug and can articulate my emotions better.	Not too interested in sex anymore.	I take one Prozac 20 mg in the morning.

As the dosage taken of Neurontin lessened and that of Lyrica increased so did the side effects. Patient was taken totally off of Lyrica and, successfully, placed back on Neurontin.

Getting unrefreshed sleep every other night	I have been taking Xyrem for about 2 months. I sleep about 5 to 5 1/2 hours every night. I wake up between 3 to 3 1/2 hour after the 1st dose and then I sleep for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours after the 2nd dose and am unable to fall asleep. The weirdest thing is that I get a refreshing sleep every other day. On the days that I wake up exhausted, I am barely able to make it through the day and am hungry all the time. The next night, I usually sleep well and have a better day there after. I am going to stop taking it and I am going to explore other options such as Rozerem or Trazodone
238	wellbutrin-xl	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	low energy and depression	I became a happier person and felt like living and being active again. I was a better mother and wife. I could focus and was not lethargic or sad.	The side effects mostly were related to low sex drive.	I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and then depression. I was treated first for the hypothyroidism and then the depression. The Zoloft worked but I still felt like I had a lower than normal energy level. My doctor added in the Wellbutrin to give me the energy boost.
3314	rifadin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	mrsa abcess	The abcess and inflammation around the area disappeared. It is very important that MRSA abcesses be treated immediately. If you have a history of MRSA, get to your doctor and begin medication as quickly as possible. Rifmapin is a very effective drug for MRSA infections. The doctor will do a workup of all the effective medications against your specific MRSA infection and choose the appropriate antibiotic.	There were no side effects that I encountered. The drug must be taken on an empty stomach, which is not the case for many other antibiotics. If the drug is not taken on an empty stomach, its effects will be diluded and the drug will be less potent against the infection. It is always recommended to follow the instructions for any drug very closely, and as for rifampin, take it on an empty stomach.	"""This is very helpful to me. Thanks."""
3306	zoloft	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	"I have debilitating panic attacks. After I was on Zoloft for a couple of weeks I noticed a substantial difference. I no longer felt the ""looming dread"" that comes with a panic attack and I just felt calmer and more in control than before. I was finally able to get my life back and felt more at ease."	I went off of Zoloft on my own in October of 2008. I went down gradually from 50mg to 25 for about a week and then went off completely. The two weeks afterward were a bit crazy. The panic attacks didn't come back but I'd get all emotional at the slightest upset and feel like crying for no reason (which isn't me at all). I also had the strangest, most vivid dreams. I recently went back on the drug after the panic attacks came back and apart from slight dizzyness and diarrhea I'm starting to feel more in control again and less panicky.	My family doctor prescribed it for panic attacks. I saw a psychiatrist years ago but it really didn't do much apart from giving me tips on what to do constructively if I have a panic attack. Which of course didn't help because when you're paralyzed with fear you can't do much of ANYTHING constructive with your time.

3619	retin-a	2	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Occasionally, acne would subside slightly.	Excessively dry skin and irritation	I was to apply the Retin-A cream twice a day but the side effects outweighed any effects of treatment.
3476	ambien-cr	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	insomnia	None.  It didn't help me sleep.  I was cranky the next day, depressed, and tired.	I took it for 2 days.  The third day I didn't take it.  Which was tonight.  I keep waking up because my subconsious is terrified of something.  I keep hearing things in my sleep.  I am terrified to go back to sleep. My heart is pounding from the horrible things I keep hearing in my sleep.  I never had this until taking this medication. I think I may miss a day of work tomorrow from not being able to sleep.  I wish someone was here with me so I wouldn't be so afraid to go back to sleep but the sounds I keep hearing are so terrifying.	My doctor gave me some samples for insomnia.
556	doryx	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	None!	Hair loss! More Acne!	Please dont take this medicine it made my acne horrible! I only had mild acne in my chin area.

440	avodart	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	The treatment stopped hair loss and caused some regrowth. Some loss of effectiveness (I beieve due to worsening of underlying condition), but adding a topical solution corrected this.	Difficult to know. May have been slight reduction in libido, and occasional mild depression/anxiety, but not sure about these.	"""I am 68 and have been using Avodart and Tamusolin together now for about a month.  A serious side effect suffered is extreme difficulty obtaining an erection and/or ejaculation.  A minor side effect has been light-headedness.  At my age the serious side effect does not really bother me but being light-headed is a concern in my employment as a transit driver.  I believe the Tamusolin is the light-headedness culprit but my doctor does not want me to continue it much longer."""
2412	synthroid	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	i have mild hypothyroidism, so i wasn't necessarily aware of what having an underfunctioning was doing to my body.  still, i was able to detect changes (for the better) after taking synthroid for a few months.  the primary benefit i aw was HIGHLY HIGHLY improved concentration, which has made school/work such a pleasure.  i think my metabloism also improved slightly.	none, as far as i could see.	take your pill everyday at the same time.  i found that morning is best, because you need to wait an hour to eat after taking the pill.  i take it right when i wake up, then get ready, and then have breakfast right at the one hour mark.

3716	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder and depression	I'm feeling more grounded; highs and lows are less extreme.  You could say that my emotional 'playing field' is more level.	"There's one 'side effect' - and I'm purposely and playfully/sarcastically placing it within quotes:  this stuff has increased my sex-drive manyfold! I don't know if this has been the case with other patients, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has had that experience.
I'm also presenting with a little 'feathery tickle', resulting in an annoying dry cough; perhaps this side effect will lessen as my body adapts to the medication."	"""I am bipolar 2 and take 300mg per day.

Has changed my life so much. Helped me kick my alcohol addiction and impulsiveness. The last two years have been great.

No drug is perfect however, and the withdrawals can be bad. Make sure you take it every day. So I gave it an 8 because I feel great if I keep up with it.

I take it right after I wake up because it helps wake me up and gives me energy. Also makes me very patient with myself, other people and just life in general throughout the day.

At my current dosage I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to call it a smart drug for me because it lessons my impulsive tendencies and quickness to anger.

If this doesn&#039;t work for you, don&#039;t fret, I study medicine, and there is usually always something available to help."""
2888	avita	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	wrinkles	There were no treatment benefits--See below--I hoped to begin to see some effects after several months but because I had so much difficulty with it I gave up.	My skin became so irritated and red that I stopped using it.  I was using just a small amount and still had trouble with irritation and small, watery itchy bumps appearing, primarily around my nose and mouth.  The prescription strength was probably too high and because it was purchased in Mexico it also may not have been from a trustworthy source.	I had used Differin in the past with good results but was considerably younger then--in this last round I tried it hoping to reduce wrinkles but couldn't proceed with using it due to irritation etc.
1260	provigil	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	narcolepsy	"improvement in daytime wakefulness without the ""peaks and valleys"" previously experienced taking prescription Ritalin for this condition. There's no excessive nervousness or feeling like I'm taking speed.  I just don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep."	None that I'm aware of.  I am starting to wonder if it has effected the health of my gum tissue, but there is no documented evidence to support that.	Once daily medication to deter excessive daytime sleepiness associated with sleep disorder Narcolepsy.  Downside of it is that it is VERY expensive.
4097	chantix	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	smoking cessation	This drug blocked the receptors for nicotine, so the cravings were extremely diminished. The dosage was increased over a week, so the physical withdrawal symptoms were decreased slowly.	The worst side effect was nausea.  When I reached the twice daily dose, I was nauseated most of the day. It was much better when I cut the pills in half and took them several times a day with plenty of liquid and food.  The other side effect is constipation. A low dose of a laxitive is helpful with this.	"I have quit smoking many times.  This time with Chantix has been the smoothest. 
The physical withdrawal was easier than times in the past.  I was somewhat irritable for a few days, but nothing severe.  The nausea and constipation were annoying, but I was able to work around them. The mental obsession of this addiction is still present at times, but no pill is going to make that go away. It has gotten easier with time."
3847	voltaren	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	osteo arthritis	Without the Voltarin, every step I take makes my joints feel like cracking glass and they ache constantly.

3442	tazorac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adult acne/wrinkles	After skin finally healed - treatment areas were improved.	My skin became very red and dry and was difficult to cover-up while it was healing.  Skin also became itchy as it was dry and tight.  My skin is normally very resilient and I get chemical peels and use Obaji products.	I applied a pea size amount nightly to my face.  The gel was greasy and does not dry like a lightweight gel.  My RX Insurance did not cover any amount of the product - I had to pay full price for the prescription.

It has alleviated my symptoms except for a slight cough.	None.	I have allergies that were getting progressively worse so I needed something to help me get through the day. I took benadryl without consulting my doctor which helped but the drowsiness was unmanageable. So my doctor told me to try zyrtec and I feel like it has helped tremendously. I only have a slight cough throughout the day but it is manageable. I wish it would take my cough away as well but I can deal with it. I take 10 mg in the morning but my doctor said to take it at night because it might cause drowsiness. It hasn't caused me drowsiness so I take it in the morning because it is easier to remember.

1658	evoclin	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	acne	The acne cleared up but the evoclin was used in combination with proactiv.  Proactiv was used before and then started getting acne again. Then I was given evoclin and used both and the acne cleared up and the whiteheads and blackheads disappeared.  there was also a increase in the softness and suppleness of the facial skin.	As far as I know there are no side effects.	I wash with proactiv in the morning and at night. I apply the evoclin at night only.

1712	retin-a-micro	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	At first, the acne on my face just went away. It's best for when you use it only once in a while.	I got my prescription for Retin-A Micro refilled about 2 months ago because it worked so well that I ran out of it! Now when I get acne and I apply the cream before bed, I wake up and there's no difference. The acne's still as big and as red as before. My skin must've gotten used to it or something, because it doesn't get rid of my acne.	I apply it before bed each night and the acne's still the same. It worked great at first, but now I don't use it anymore.

I took 1mg at night (up from an initial 1/2 mg dose) before bed as a treatment for sleep walking/talking and the inability to progress to deep sleep. This medicine worked great at first, but after 6 months I was no longer seeing a benefit.  The doctor took me off of it for 2 weeks as a drug holiday to let my brain rest, and had to put me on another med during that time because I had terrible insomnia as a result of withdrawal (I have never had insomnia in my life).  I do have some short term memory problems, but overall saw a bigger benefit to feeling better and an increased quality of life to stop taking the drug.

To help me thru the early stages of the grief process in stroke recovery, which I guess it did, my emtotions were volatile at times, very hard time emotionally for a bit.

Started this medication in October 2008 for my suspiciousness of people (thought people were out to get me).  Began at 0.25 mg once a day for a week, then increased to 0.5 mg a day at night.  3 weeks later (1 month from the time of starting risperidone), increased to 1 mg every night.  Stayed on 1 mg for a few months when the symptoms came back.  Dose increased to 1.5 mg a day.  Depression set in (for outside life factors...not due to medication) and fluoetime added at 10 mg a day and risperidone decreased to 1 mg a day due to flueoxetine increasing the levels of risperidone.  Depression still there and psychotic symptoms came back.  At next vist (1 month) flueoxetine increased to 20 mg every morning and risperidone increased back to 1.5 mg a day.  Two months later psychotic symptoms would come back in the middle of the day (as if the medication was wearing off).  Rispreridone dosage changed to 1 mg twice a day.  Which is still the current dosage I am on.

I was happy that it only made me feel mildly nauseous for a day or so.  I feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  I was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile, but after a reduced my caffeine intake, that subsided.  My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.

"It did make me mildly nauseous for the first day that I was on it. After that, all good.  It made my hands very shaky for awhile, but that seems to have subsided for the most part, particularly since I cut my caffeine intake.  Given that it's an amphetamine derivative, it make since that adding another stimulant might lead to side effects.

I don&#039;t take these much anymore; rather here and there for things like interviews or XR for days that I know will involve agitation.I wouldn&#039;t suggest them for long-term use; not necessarily because side effects - but largely because, as someone with depression, it seemed to make it worse; i.e. I felt slightly more &#039;flat&#039; and as if I was sinking lower on them. That said, pathology of depression varies a lot as does individual biology - so not everyone will have this problem. If you&#039;re looking at using them long-term you&#039;re best giving a few antidepressants a go. Otherwise, these have that wee bit of mild physical sedation ergo less hectic mental focus that can be handy here and there."""

Sexual disfunction- ie inability to have a full orgasm- and after 2 years of this, thi sis one of the reasons why I am ready to change to Gabapentin- as recommended by my doc. Sleepiness etc goes away after the first few weeks although it took me a good 6 months to properly adapt to this drug	10mg at night for the first 6 months, then the pain came through again so I upped this to 25mg per day. Six months ago, I wasn;t aware of any pain behind the pain that I had been used to so, thinking I was maybe a bit better, I cut the intake down to 12.5 mg a day by cutting my 25mg tablet in half each night. this was fine until a week ago when the shocking shooting pain returned accompanied by pin-prick sensations on my face and on my limbs- I've not had thi sin 2 years. I intend to try gabapentin now, although some people have referred to it as the 'zombie drug'. My main reason for not upping the Nortrip back to 25mg, is that I want to see if I will be able to have an orgasm on the Gaba- although maybe this is a luxury- as anyone with nerve pain knows, sex is the last thing on your mind when you are in such pain. But who knows, maybe I will be able to be pain-free and get my libido back...!

I sometimes wonder if I really need it, so occasionally I stop taking it, but within 3 to 4 days, the pain comes back full force, so I know it is effective.  It is slightly less effective than Vioxx.

It took some time to identify this problem and I discovered it myself rather than being tested for it.	"Metformin was the treatment of choice for my diabetes as it does not produce weight gain.

My coughing and infection dramatically subsided, however, the side effects made me feel so badly I quit taking it.	This was prescribed to me for possible whooping cough...due to exposure to Pertusis through my daughter.  Even though my older daughter had received the Pertusis vaccine she still was finally diagnosed as having whooping cough.  It took several doctors to finally catch what she had.

2689	prinivil	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	It did lower my blood pressure, although my physician wanted to lower it further because I started out on 10 mg a day so the medication doseage was raised to 20 mg which as been more effective at lowering my blood pressure.  Even though my blood pressure wasn't dangerously high since cardiovascular issues run in my family my doctor wanted me to take this drug because of family history even though I am young.	On the 10 mg dosage I noticed that my throat was itchy and scratchy, causing a lot of cough and some gagging with the cough.  For some reason this problem disappeared when I was switched to the 20 mg dosage.  At times I get a bit of ringing in my ears but it is not regular.  I do notice fatigue and although I have started taking other medications after starting the lisinopril I think the lisinopril did affect my libido, although not a lot.	Mostly pleased with lisinopril because it is effective at keeping my blood pressure down.  Due to a one time mail in problem with my prescription service I was off the lisinopril for approximately a week and my blood pressure went right back up, and was under control again a few days after starting up.  I keep track of my blood pressure at home and it regularly remains in a very good range of 128/60 or so with some variations.  I am hoping not to stay on the drug for long term but since my blood pressure went right back up after a short time of not taking it I'm not sure how short term it may be.

She and I were both sensitive, angry, sad, and sometimes suicidal. I have just lived with it, not really taking meds much. I have to notice a difference in a few days if I am going to stick with something. My aunt told my sister that the people in our family do well on Paxil. My sister felt that it worked for her for a year or two, so I started taking it because it has reached a point where I have to be happy or die from stress. the Paxil had a noticeable effect on my anxiety levels in a matter of days, and an effect on my level of general happiness in a matter of a week or two. The doctor prescribed 20 mg which I just can't take because it makes me too sleepy the next day. I take 10mg which was enough for the first month. Now 10 mg is almost not enough, I can feel the anxiety there sometimes but more Paxil will make me sleepy. My 10 year old son inherited the family depression problem, he's been talking about killing himself and others. He started taking Paxil also, I have noticed a big difference. He is not angry so much anymore. It is helping us truly. I usually won't take prescriptions, I think they make people sicker sometimes. I will keep taking this stuff as long as the benefits outweigh the problems.

By day three it was becoming an issue when sitting down and getting up, to the point where I thought I might rupture the achilles tendon. I had never had any issues in my lower legs before. By day four I was having a lot of trouble walking and could only shuffle around. I stopped taking the drug and requested a different antibiotic. On reading up on it, I discovered I it should never have been prescribed for me - I am 61 years old and being treated with corticosteroids for RA. It was prescribed by the ER Physician and my Family Doctor.	I stopped taking the drug after 4 days. It took me 6-8 weeks to be able to walk normally again. In the 3rd week we had plans to go to a wedding out of the country, and I required wheelchair assistance at the three aiports we went through to get there. I would have missed my flights if I had had to walk.

Very dry skin, sensitivity to sun, red/dry eyes, severe dry lips, frequent nose bleeds and rashes, minor depression, back pains, and easily worn out.	I am only 15 and wanted to not have to fight acne for the rest of my teen years. I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications, but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes, the side effects were odious, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end! Accutane can really boost your self confidence. I would recommend on giving it a try. It could change your life forever!

3159	prednisone	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe recurrent sinus infections	I was given a short course of prednisone to take, along with whatever antibiotic I was currently on, whenever the antibiotic alone was not clearing up the sinus infection.  The prednisone worked like a charm, but at a cost.	Sleeplessness!  Taking the prednisone was like drinking ten cups of coffee every night or like being on speed.  I had unnatural amounts of energy -- nervous energy -- and wore myself out during the time I was taking the prednisone.  It always helped to clear up the infection, but then I had to recover from the prednisone.  This is a scary drug.	In addition to whatever antibiotic I was currently on, I was to take 9 mg. of prednisone -- the first few times, it was 3 mg with each meal, but that was really too much, so later we did the three tabs all at once in the morning -- a day for several days, sometimes as few as 7, sometimes as many as 15.  Then, I had to taper off the amount I took for several days, in 3 mg increments for a few days each new dose.  Finally, I would be off it.  This time.

I feel more ""chill"", though I still do experience free floating anxiety. My mood is significantly improved, but the anxiety, while lower, is the most stubborn of the symptoms."	Thirst, tremor, slight weight gain, occassional nausea	I have been taking the medication for a year. I had started at 900 mg daily, but found that while I was improved, there was still room for improvement, so the dose was increased to 1200 mg/d. Of all the medications I have taken for bipolar disorder, this has been the most effective; and the cheapest too lol!!

"""I&#039;ve been on Alesse for three months now, and although I haven&#039;t suffered any weight loss/gain, acne or nausea I have felt extremely fatigued and lethargic. Not to mention the fact that my period would randomly start halfway through when I still had 7 or 8 active pills left. And when my period did start I would suffer bouts of depression, crying for no reason, spending all day in bed and entertaining a few suicidal thoughts. 

I will be discontinuing use of Alesse and I plan to speak with my doctor about other alternatives.

I wept for about a week - I had no idea what was going on at first, and then I realized that - I could actually FEEL my emotions.  I felt normal and healthy.  I regret going off of this drug too soon, as I did.  I switched to Wellbutrin, which was not a good idea.	Mild drowsiness.  Emotionalism.	over the counter.

3362	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	The daily itchy throat and coughing spells have stopped.  I no longer have to carry cough drops with me for daily attacks.  I can now visit my children's homes who have cats and dogs.  Before taking this medication, cats caused sever asthma, itchy eyes, nasal congestion.  Taking a regimine of singular every day, prevents these symptoms upon interaction with cats.  Prior to taking singular, exposure to a home with dogs caused symptoms similar to flu..achiness, rhinitis, sneezing and runny nose.  After singular...symptom free.  My doctor advised that there is no risk in taking the medication long term, so I plan to continue its prophylactic effect.	Dry nasal passages are the major side effect.  This is no so bad, since I use a nasal moisturizer to help with this side effect.  I do notice that when I take singular at bedtime I experience tingling in my legs, and when I don't take it, there is none...so this may be a possible side effect.  I experience dry lips, but not sure if that is a result of taking singular.	Not sure what this means...I am surprised and happy with prevention of allergy symptoms.  I see my allergist once a year to be sure that it is safe and can be taken with other meds.  He  asked if I wanted to discontinue it, since I was doing so well, and I said no...only if there is a risk with long term usage.  He said there was no risk.

I have lost jobs, missed family outings and missed many opportunties due to migraine,  Zomig changed all of that and allowed me to take the medication and go to work and all the outings that I had missed.  I had a young family when I discovered Zomig and it was like a miracle was handed to me.	Thankfully there are none.  I am able to function completely both at home and work.  There are 2 ways I take the drug.  If I feel the headache start and I am at work I take a pill and usually I get relief within 15 minutes.  The only drawback is that I may have to take another pill within 12 hours. On the other hand if I am able to take the pill and lay down for 20 minutes then usually I can get up and resume all of my activities.  This is truly my wonder drug that has allowed me to fully participate in life.  I do not know where I would be without it.

I stopped feeling sad and crying. I was able to concentrate again.  My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized.	The drug made me nauseated the first month I took it.

My symptoms included crying, lack of interest in life, inability to concentrate, loss of appetite, and sleeping more than usuual. I could barely get out of bed and I could not function.

3983	fosamax	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	early onset osteoporosis	I was led to believe my bone density would improve with this drug and it would only need to be administered once a week.	After two months, leg pain and weakness throughout body.  I was an avid camper and hiker, and I lost a considerable amount of endurance and strength in my whole body.  Leg pain woke me up several times during the night.  The leg pain was not like cramping, but more like general dull aching, only sometimes severe.  By the third month I could not lie on my side (one side was worse than the other), because the pain was so intense.  I felt it resonating from my hip joint and going down my legs. When I awoke in the morning, my usual sprint to the bathroom was replaced by tiny hobbling steps; I was extremely weak in the morning.	I elected to stop taking Fosamax because of side effects (above).  My physician is concerned and wants me to try a different osteoporosis medication, but I am afraid to take anything like that again.  I have elected to self medicate with liquid calcium citrate/magnesium formula, and other vitamin and mineral therapy.

The bruising took two weeks to completely clear and the lost lid crease never completely returned to normal so is being monitored by my physician and the manufacturer of the Dysport since this was an unusual outcome.	Injections were adminsitered by a board certified opthamologist and plastic surgeon who has specal training with this product and instructs other physiians in its use.  She couldnot explain my poor outcome other than to say I had very reisistant muscles and the furrowing was very deep.

Unable to concentrate, sleeplessness, dizzyness, very dry mouth, continuous clenching of teeth, all my joints painful.	"""I was on citalopram for nearly 3 years and I don&#039;t think it worked. The only positive thing I can say about it is that there weren&#039;t any side-effects.

2448	adcirca	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	difficulty getting/holding erection	I might as well have not taken it at all. I noticed no difference in trying to achieve an erection than without it. When erection was achieved it went away quickly. The strength of erection was minimal. Not impressed at all.	Massive headache an hour or so after ingesting the pill as well as heavy clogged sinuses. Found it hard to breath. Felt like flu symptoms.	The only thing this pill gave me was strong flu-like symptoms. I'll try it again and see if the results are better but so far I'm not impressed at all and $80 in the hole. Complete waste of money and suffered flu symptoms the entire next day. It's very difficult to be in the mood for sex when you feel sick with a throbbing headache.

4127	chantix	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	to help quit smoking cigarettes	"I was able to quit smoking 2 1/2 yrs ago.  I had smoked 2 1/2 packs of menthols for 35 years.  No one,including me, thought I could ever quit.  The Chantix kept me from feeling any withdrawal from nicotine and made it so smoking didn't give me the ""boost"" it had.  There became no point in smoking.  I kept the last prescription to take ""PRN' when in certain situations.  It also took a little mental work."	Only one I noticed was waking up feeling like I'd had bad dreams.  I didn't realize it was a side effect until reading about it later.  A few bad dreams was well worth the results.	"You take 1/2 dose pills for maybe a week in the starter pack.  Then move to full strength.  Take 1 in the morning and one in the evening or late day.  Try to establish a ""quit"" day before starting.  I didn't.  I used it for 2-3 weeks while I tapered down and worked on the psychological aspects.  After 2 days of only having 1 cig a day, I stopped.  After 4 months, my insurance no longer paid.  I needed longer and paid full price.  I used my last box PRN.  When I'd be in an evening situation where I thought it might be difficult, I'd take one a few hours before going and it would work.  Taking only 1 in the daytime did NOT result in the bad dreams.  I ended up with a few pills left over.

Ruptured her esophagus.  Never did find out what caused this but i figure the fosamax caused a very very small hole in the esophagus, weakened the side and the camera scope tore a hole. When fixed, there was no more pain in the stomach.  She is alright now--but almost died from this	See above for treatment details as I don't know what more I could say.

Forgetfullness, some manifestation of laissez-faire attitude (not caring as much about work issues, but in some ways this is a good thing!

It doesn't make you sleepy or passive. It doesn't kill your sex drive, though it is reduced a bit, and it's still harder to reach orgasm. Best part about this med is that it doesn't make you sleepy or foggy. 

You may have to increase dosage after a couple of years. It started to poop out on me at about year 3, and since then I've been climbing with the dosage. 

I've tried many anti-depressants, and this is the gold standard for me. Paxil robbed me of many years...no ambition, no focus, very sloppy housekeeping. Effexor is much better."

438	imitrex	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	Since my hypothyroidism is being better treated I rarely get a migraine anymore. I get one every couple of months or so. I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too.	Side effects for me include: Heaviness in my limbs, muscle aches, tight feeling in head, flushing, increased heart rate, drowsiness.	Take 100 mg at first indication of migraine. May repeat dosage after 2 hours if pain isn't relieved. Thereafter, only 1 may be taken in a 24 hour period.

2358	propecia	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hair loss	My hair loss that I was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks, and I actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  Every individual to whom I've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  I'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. Once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on.	While they are forced to tell you that there is something like a 5% chance of becoming temporarily impotent, even for the people that effects the literature says that the majority of that small number get back their sex drive while continuing to take the drug. If you stop taking the drug it comes back immediately. I've not experienced any lessening of my libido, nor has anyone else that I've recommended the drug to.	"You have to have a doctor's prescription, but to avoid the annoyance and price of a doctor's visit you can go to several websites that allow you to pay an extra fee, fill out a questionaire and then have a doctor who is on their payroll give you the prescription. That is okay because really if you're having hair loss and you know you are, why do you need a dermatolagist to tell you- ""yeah, you're losing your hair""? It's an idiotic rule that makes this a controlled drug.  Anyway you take one pill a day- that's it, with or without meals."

3639	retin-a	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Reduced acne.  I had mild/moderate acne, and Retin-A did decrease the amount of ance I had.  I liked Retin-A also because it reduces wrinkles.  I am only 28, so I don't have many wrinkles, but used it as prevention.	My skin would become too dry.  It seemed that even after months of usage, my ance would not completely disappear.  If I used more Retin-A, my acne would get better for a week or two until my skin became too dry and then I would have worse acne	I would apply Retin-A to my face once a day at night

Not a problem at night, but had to be careful taking medication when working or driving.	Initially prescribed 1 mg. 3x a day for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Adjusted dosage to take incrementally .25 -.5 mg. as needed.
558	doryx	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	My acne was significantly reduced. My doctor added the oral medicince because using topical acne medications did not slow the acne pimples.

68	flexeril	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	muslce inflammation	I was taking Flexeril for muscle inflammation in my ribs caused by sever coughing from bronchitis.  It helped with the pain a lot and helped me sleep through the night.	I didn't experience any side effects.  It did make me tired but I expected that.  I did feel a bit hung over the next day like you would if you took tylenol pm or similar.  I'd recommend taking it when you know you have 8-10 hours to sleep.	Flexeril has been highly effective for my pain.
1648	estratest	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause - hrt	Hormone replacement therapy is used to control menopause symptoms - I need to take prometrium with estrogen to prevent uterine cancer.

I took it off and on in the past for UTIs due to having 4 urether instead of two. Then I had to take it for 9 months while I was pregnant (one a day for prevention), never had a problem. 
Now years later, Just had a hysterectomy and had a UTI again. Asked for macrobid and within two days the pain is gone and I am getting better. Couldn&#039;t live without this medicine. I don&#039;t know what these people are talking about."""

232	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Aided in decreasing symptoms of depression, and also reduced craving for cigarettes as a bonus.  Noticeably less lethargy.	Side effects were generally positive, including help with smoking cessation as well as increased libido, which had decreased on Lexapro.

Lexapro was taken in evening, Wellbutrin XL in the morning.
136	valtrex	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	genital herpes	Shortened duration of herpes outbreak.	No side effects were noticed. The outbreak itself usually can have body aches and fever.	At the first sign of a possible outbreak I would beging taking the medication. It would be taken twice daily for three days. Discussed possible daily dosage if outbreaks became more frequent. I decided to try a more natural approach with Lysine taken at any signs with very similar results.
3364	lipitor	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	cholesterol slightly elevated	I didn't take the product long enough to evaluate the benefits. I quit because of side effects.	Very painful muscles, it took a while to even get them going in the morning.	When my cholesterol was found to be slightly elevated, my cardiologist put me on Lipitor. The first week was fine. The beginning of the second week I began to have sore muscles all over. By the end of the second week this was so bad I could hardly get out of bed in the morning. So I quit the Lipitor (did not consult the doctor on this); in the AARP magazine (or else newsletter, not sure which) there was a question for the medical doctor about possible natural replacements for the statin medications and he recommended Red Yeast Rice. I found a product with that and a few other cholesterol-lowering supplements (primarily CoQ-10) ad have been taking that with no side effects. I am due for another blood test in a couple of weeks, so we will see how well it has been working.
2775	clindamycin	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	throat infection	Throat infection cleared up by the 2nd day of treatment.	Esophageal irritation making it really painful to have anything like tea or eating anything hot because it feels like it's scraping your esophagus before it reaches your stomach.	"""Hi. I started taking clindamycin about an hour ago for a bacterial infection (upper respiratory / sinus infection). Within only several minutes my esophagus started burning and I feel like throwing up. I have only had one dose of 300mg. I was started on clindamycin because I had bad side effects (numbness and tingling in my hands) to another antibiotic (clarithromycin). Clarithromycin really helped treat the infection, but I stopped it after 3 days. I&#039;m allergic to penicillin so that makes things harder. My doctor warned me about the harshness of clindamycin, but I thought that I&#039;d rather have some GI issues than neuropathy as a side effect - which is still true, but I can&#039;t imagine taking even another dose as I feel so sick."""
3367	lipitor	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	cholesterol	No.  They were harmful to me.	Yes.  All kinds of side effects and several trips to Quest for blood work to find out what was happening to my body. On 10/31/07 these were my readings My AST was 384 instead of 10-35,  My Alt was 655 instead of 6-40,  By 5/1/08 after I stopped taking it for 7 months my readings were AST 37 and ALT 76 a big improvement	"I couldn't walk because of muscle problems.  Then it attacked my kidney and bladder.  Drs thought I had cancer.

3876	levoxyl	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Improved metabolism, decreased depression, increased energy, decreased hair loss, and improved finger/toenail condition.	There were no side effects.	I have been taking Levoxyl for 7 years. In that time, I have had no problems with depression and was able to cease taking an antidepressant. My metabolism is regular. I have no problems with fatigue.
3393	coumadin	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	blood clots	Prevented a recurrence of the leg and lung clots during the period of therapy and helped the body stabilize long enough to repair and/or work around the damaged areas, eventually resulting in elimination of pain and swelling.	Minor bruising and longer bleeding times with cuts, but nothing serious. Occasional dizziness when the INR counts went above 3 or 4. It's difficult at times to get a stable INR reading due to all the various foods, supplements, and drugs which either increase or decrease Coumadin's effects.	Prescribed Coumadin after DVT and PE stay (with IV heparin first) for six months. Weekly blood tests until INR levels stabilized, then biweekly. One 5 mg pill taken daily with warnings to watch food, drug and supplement intake.
1226	ultracet	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	post surgery	Analgesic post surgery without use of codeine (patient has allergy).	Mild constipation	While I found the medication moderately effective for pain relief, I seemed to build up a tolerance to it quickly, so that it had a progressively less pronounced effect over the course of a few days. Pro: patient may be less likely to become dependent on the drug if it is taken as prescribed, because the effect tapers off. Con: Not useful as a long-term pain reducer because patient may eventually start taking more than the prescribed dosage to achieve pain relief.
3008	cipro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	serious food poisoning, uti	"I landed in a West African hospital with my insides coming out and suffering from the worst stomach pain as a result of (probably) eating bad food. I vomited for 12 hours until I got the drip and then I was okay for the next couple days in the hospital (although the stomach pains remained).

Cipro is also the god of beating Urinary tract infections: I've taken both a 3 and 5 day course, and its been effective instantly."	I had no side effects.	For UTI, take one every 12 hours for prescribed number of days. (And finish the whole course!)
3901	nexium	8	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux/chronic bronchitis	I found that it did nothing for my acid reflux.  Only after I changed how, what and when I ate did I recieve instant relief from both the acid reflux and the chronic bronchitis.		"I was hospitalized for pancreatitis and that's when the coughing started.  The pancreatitis subsided but the coughing worsened, especially at night.  I was diagnosed with acid reflux and ""hyperinflated lungs"", whatever that means.  The coughing would keep me up all night.  I saw both an allergist and a pulmonologist; the allergist prescribed Nexium and the pulmonologist prescribed Advair, the nasal spray with the bee spokesperson, and an inhaler that made me so jittery that I did not sleep for an entire night when I took it.  He also prescribed a codeine syrup that make me incredibly sick to my stomach.  I hated being on all those meds.  I did some research and decided to modify the size and content of my dinner, and eat it earlier in the evening.  No more snacking or ice cream after dinner.  My symptoms immediately stopped.  I took myself off all meds and never went back to those doctors -- I had no need to."
273	progesterone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe stomach pains, dizziness	I have had stomach troubles my entire life. When I was pregnant they were unbearable.  I could never take the pill because of nausea. I noticed that when I was 45 the nausea was associated with my cycle, becoming most intense just prior to my period.  My gastroenterologist prescribed Nexium, which I took for a year, maximum dosage, daily and then tapered off. Then the other symptoms above emerged. When I started with the progesterone all these symptoms subsided significantly and I rarely ever have stomach problems now.	None at all that I am aware of.	"""I was diagnosed 5 months ago with hyperplasia. I had experienced extreme periods with clotting and 7-10 bleeding for over 5 years. I thought this was normal for women approaching menopause, it is NOT. I was also 30-40 Lbs. over weight. My gynecologist put me on progesterone pills and a few months later she did a D&amp;C. She told me my hyperplasia was gone and the best benefit is that i have no periods. I can&#039;t say enough about this pill. I am beyond child baring years so no periods is such a bonus!"""

Average 2 awakenings during the night, but able to fall back to sleep immediately.  Average 7-8 hours of sleep per night (without treatment average was 3-4 hours sleep per night with many awakenings).	Mild short-term memory loss	"""I have severe sleep problems and now take 50mg of doxepin nightly. I fall asleep and stay asleep. I have tried numerous other meds and most either don&#039;t work or work for only a short period of time, this has not been a problem with doxepin."""
1611	avage	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti aging	Avage contributed to maximum exfoliation to treat both hyperpigmentaion and minimization of lines, creases and wrinkles. It also helped to minimize pore size and added a more radiant look to my skin (it was very dull and drab).	Some type of basic moisturizing cream must be applied over the Avage. If the moisturizer was not used the avage was to strong to use daily. I have used Avage without a moisturizer on a every other day time table.	after 30+ days skin condition greatly improved. Avage contributed to maximum exfoliation to treat both hyperpigmentaion and minimization of wrinkles and anti aging. It also helped to minimize pore size and added a more radiant look to my skin (it was very dull and drab).
2246	zovirax	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	cold sore, fever blister	This ointment seemed to lessen the severity of the outbreak and duration.	None noted	I applied the ointment several times a day.  The sooner the application after the first symptom (usually tingling) the more effective.  As I stated still had the outbreak but the ointment did lessen the severity and duration.
3294	zoloft	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	traumatic brain injury	"Zoloft made me feel considerably better, which is to say it decreased the severity and frequency of my ""why me"" or ""I suck"" bouts, but the underlying facts were still the same."	There was a definite decrease in sexual desire and performance, but it is hard to say if the zoloft is to be blamed for everything.	I was put on zoloft while still in the hospital having suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury. I was just taking whichever pills the doctors set out for me, and when i left the hospital i just continued taking zoloft, because i knew i was going to be depressed. I continued taking it for about a year and a half after leaving the hospital but eventually wanted to try living with a clear mind. When I stopped the dosage gradually (as one is well advised) I went on living ok, but was still depressed. I was looking for something to take my mind off the recovery, so of course i dabbled in alcohol and the occasional marijuana use, but I eventually went on to realize that i didn't need any drugs at all. There is something to be said for a natural high, but i decided to put myself back on the lowest dose of zoloft in hopes of clearing my mind so that i could go back to school without the depression hampering my focus.
699	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Completely cleared up mild to moderate acne on face, neck, shoulders, back, and arms and should continue to stay clear for some length of time.	Dry, chapped lips and dry, flaky skin especially after showers. Both were completely treatable with chapstick and good lotion. No serious side effects, and no alarming changes in liver function or triglycerides on blood tests. No depression as well.	I had slight to moderate acne that was just really annoying and was not fixed by any type of treatment, so I finally gave in and went on Accutane. After reading all the online horror stories I was scared out of my mind. However, I had a great experience on it. I took 80mg/day for 5 months and weigh 200 lbs (90 kgs) so it was about 1 mg/day/kg, which is a moderate to high dose I was told. My lips were pretty dry and cracked if I didn't put on chapstick all the time. I also had really dry skin if I didn't put lotion on my shoulders, arms, back, and face after showering. Everything else was 100% fine though. No nosebleeds, no depression, no hair loss, no unbearable side effects. These horror stories are overblown and rare, and tons of people have great results on it. My acne is gone 100% from all over my body and it is such a relief to not have to deal with it. On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne, give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.
3818	nolvadex	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	breast cancer	prevention of recurrence of estrogen positive tumours	severe menopause symptoms - hot flashes, cold sweats causing disturbed sleep and insomnia. symptoms seen to be worse after herceptin and the most distressing is the inability to get warm.

3172	prednisone	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	chest infection (viral)	I feel much better and this is only the second day on the medication. When the Prednisone is in my system it feels like I am almost completely better. Once it wears off (before my next day) I am still sick but better than the day before.	Some side effects for me are wide awake, hyper, jittery, plugged ears (needs to be popped) joint pain and discomfort in my knees, ankles, and hips (almost like an arthritis feeling but not sore, just awkward.	Before I started on the Prednisone I was sick for 2 weeks with a viral infection the chest (chest) my wheezing was really bad and I was prescribed to Symbicort Corticosteroid inhaler twice per day to help with the inflammation and airways. After a few days I was still getting worse and did feel  minimal comfort from the puffer, and my overall infection was getting worse. I went back to the doctor and they added in a Ventolin puffer to open the airways 2 puffs 4 times per day in between the symbicort. 5 days later I went back to the doctor wheezing more and with a sort of stuffy nose and serious nasal pain (mostly from coughing so much. He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system.. I took my first prednisone yesterday for the first time, it made me feel good for 9 hours or so but gave me some joint pain. The next day I felt a little better but still coughing and sick until I took the Prednisone again. (today at 2:00pm) It is now 11:00pm and I am flighing high (thats probably why I am writing in a blog and feel awesome, I feel like I could run a marathon. I also just drank a coffee and I don't think it helped. No coughing. Hopefully I can sleep tonight.. I used to take Ritalin for ADD and this kind of feels like that. I think tomorrow I will feel a little better, great again when I am on the Prednisone, and hopefully after that the puffer will Finnish off fixing the inflammation. Did anyone get hearing loss when taking prednisone? Its like when your on an airplane and your ears need to be popped but you cant pop them. I checked online and all I could find is prednisone fixes hearing loss..haha.. weird anyways.. Overall I think it works great!
1307	fexofenadine	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	allergic rhinitis	There were no benefits as the sniffling, dripping, coughing continued even on the medicine.	Dry mouth.	"""I&#039;ve never encountered hay fever allergies prior to this spring, so as soon as it all began, I decided to do some research. Allegra looked like my best bet because it claimed that drowsiness was not a side effect, and I was told it would work quickly! I decided on the 24-hr. I have yet to notice a difference and have not been sleeping very well! """
3747	lamictal	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	epilepsy	Lamictal stopped my seizures as well as Epilim, but it gave me a considerate amount of energy.  Some would see it as a benefit to not have an appetite, even though it's bad for your health to not eat.  My depression went away with Lamictal.  Even when I had an appetite I still wouldn't eat much, which helped me greatly, since Epilim gave me terrible cravings.	"I experienced hair loss at times.  I wouldn't have an appetite and throw up if I had something to eat. I get terrible mood swings.  In the beginning I would suffer from sleeplessness.  My body would be tired, but my brain wouldn't stop working.  Don't know how to explain it.  I've had a little rash, but nothing serious.  I've been an athlete my whole life, so training and staying in shape is a big thing for me, but since I've been on Lamictal I've gained a considerate amount of weight and not being able to lose it.  I've carried on training, but my weight just stands still, after all my weight gain.  I've managed to lose 5kg's in 3 years and that was an amazing achievement for me.  My weight has made me terribly depressed, since my body isn't accustomed to it.

I went back to my Neurologist, but after driving 400km's and paying R800, he told me that I'm talking nonsense, because Lamictal has never been said to make a patient pick up weight.  There's a first time for everything you know. 

I just don't know what to do, because I just can't carry on like this.  It has affected my cycling, my running, my swimming, but he clearly doesn't give a damn."	I was on Epilim for a few months, but went over to Epitec (Lamictal) because Epilim made me very tired and depressed.  Apparently Epitec was the tablet with the least side-effects.
768	naproxen	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	auto accident, severe whiplash	helped aleviate whip lash symptoms	none that i noticed	i took the medications for the prescribed time and symptoms improved, however, I still have some symptoms which are being treated through physical therapy since the accident was only in December
3300	zoloft	9	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	pmd	I was having difficulty controlling my temper, having loss of motivation, anxiety.  This helped to take the edge off so that I could function without the extreme mood swings.	I didn't notice any side effects except that it seemed to mess with weight loss.  Going off the medication for the periods indicated by my dr seemed to help.	I was advised to take the medication daily for the week leading to my period starting.  My dr said that through trial and error I would find the best treatment plan.  Turns out I usually take it everyday except for the first day of my period and 3 - 5 days after that.  I was also advised to take 20 minute daily walk in the sun.
2308	lexapro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression & anxiety	Immediate benefits were realized, faster than my doctor anticipated. Also, I wouldn't always take Lexapro consistently, and when symptoms returned, by resuming Lexapro, I experienced results in 2-3 days.	In the beginning, I felt a little dazed and disoriented for the first 1-2 weeks of taking Lexapro. Once my body adjusted to the drug, I felt like it took the edge off irritability and made me feel like my old self. Sustaining side effects were sexual; a decrease in ability to orgasim.	10 mg of Lexapro was prescribed to be taken 1x daily. I was advised that this drug builds up in the system over time and that results generally wouldn't be measurable until taken consistently for a minimum of 4-6 weeks.
1132	evista	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	osteopenia	I didn't take the medicine long enough to get any benefits	I started having side effects within days of taking it but didn't realize it thinking that I was dealing with other health issues.  I started out having a very bad sore throat, hoarse voice and cough.  Went to a RediClini and got on antibiotic.  Also went to see a Dr. 2 days later and was given a prednisone pack because I had chest congestion and by that time I had laryngitis plus shortness of breath.  I dealt with these symptoms for 2 weeks.  Cough and wheezing got better and then I realized the connection between getting all of these symptoms and the side effects.  Checked online and sure enough, all of them were listed so I called the Dr. and stopped the medicine.  Shortness of breath is better and my voice is getting somewhat better.	None.
4036	tri-luma	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	hyperpigmentation	Mild lightening of age and sun spots.	Slight dryness at the beginning of treatment. Increased sun sensitivity.

864	valium	6	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	The valium was prescribed for the patient in an attempt to relieve anxiety prior to a minor surgery being performed.	The patient was still experiencing anxiety during the minor surgery.  After the procedure was over, the patient experienced wobbly legs and had difficulty paying attention.	Valium was prescribed for the patient to use prior to having minor surgery to relieve his anxiety.
2534	lamisil	5	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	yeast	not noticable, supposed to clear all yeast from body because I had been feeling bloated, kept getting yeast infections and when I had colonics the lady told me that I had an abundance of yeast.  Makes sense cuz I drink a lot of beer and don't eat too healthy.	none	Take one tablet, once a day for two weeks.  I was also supposed to eat a lot of yogurt and take a pro biotic pill once and a while.  Affects were not noticible and I have no idea whether I really had yeast over growth and whether it did any thing beneficial or not.
3651	retin-a	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I really did not experience any benefits.	Skin redness, flaking, photosensitivity, and irritation.	Soon after beginning treatment as directed, I began experiencing the negative side effects. I kept with the treatment for maybe 1-2 months, and then could no longer tolerate the appearance and feel of my skin. It seemed like I was more self-conscious of the side effects than I had been of the acne and breakouts (which were still present anyway).
1587	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety attacks	It was calming within a very short time.  At the onset of an attack, just having the medicine on hand was calming. It began to work very quickly after taking it.	It made me a little bit too sleepy.  It also was relaxing to the point that I felt a little disoriented.  It was a great solution as long as I was at home.  It would not have been practical to take when working, driving, etc.	It was prescribed to be taken on an as needed basis.  I would take the tablet at the onset of the attack.  The attacks usually occured at night, shortly after I feel asleep.
3628	retin-a	4	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sun damage	The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however.	There were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after.	"Topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. The recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but I found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face."
1409	adipex-p	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	weightloss	Upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that I had to remind myself to eat during the day.  It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.	At first when I started the phentermine, it made me very thirsty and a little bit jittery but that wore off after about a week.  I also had trouble falling asleep at first if I didn't take the medication early enough in the morning and woke up quite a bit throughout the night. These side effects all diminished after about a month of usage.	First I had to fill out a patient questionaire & submit blood for some blood work that was required.  I was prescribed to take one pill after breakfast in the morning. I also went in for weekly weigh ins and measurements.   They also gave me some vitamins to take along with the phentermine but I did not take those since I hate having to take any kind of pills.  Overall I am very happy with the results achieved from taking phentermine and occasionally take them when I feel myself getting off track again.
2370	propecia	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	thinning hair	Hair loss all but stopped - kept crown area full.	Brain fog, difficulty calling up names, places, or specific details at times. Very annoying. Slight loss of libido, erections affected very, very slightly (takes a small amount more time to achieve full).	Started years ago when I saw hair falling out slowly. Worked extremely well, but saw more negative reviews over the years and felt more sluggish (in my mind) over time. Decided its not worth it, and am off it cold turkey as of 4 days ago. Feeling tired, and libido is lacking. Hoping I get back to my old self ASAP. I would not recommend this drug to anyone... hair is great, feeling 100% is WAY BETTER. Looking back? I'd leave it alone.

Levothyroxine (25 mcg)was taken 30�60 minutes before breakfast daily, for almolst 2 years. The doctor told me, that i should take it as long as i live.

The infection was resistant to other antibiotics.	stomach upset at times from Augmentin.  Otherwise not really any reaction.	Two pills at 875 MG a day.  This lasted for a month.  Again my bronchial infection was resistant, or the doctor said I'd come down with the infection again [this happened in the spring two years ago, when there was a very resistant virus or infection going around and people were coming down with an infection again].  After two weeks of a regular antibiotic [azithroymicin] I was not getting better so the doctor put me on Augmentin.  It completely zapped what I had and I got over it.

It has changed my life.	I did not notice it myself but my husband told me I became rather 'cool', less sensitive.	Treated 2 years by a psychologist who prescribed the Citalopram. Three times I tried to stop and live without, but the depression returned. Now my doctor prescribes it each time for 3 months.
3923	nexium	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	Acid reflux stopped, I am told that the damage done by the effluxed acid will be healed.  But I am not sure if this drug really strengthens the sphincter such that acid reflux is stopped.  Nexium mainly reduces acid production, but does is stop the efflux is yet to be seen based on the results after stopping the treatment.	Halitosis - Bad breath from day - 2	Excellent in treating GERD.
2675	prinivil	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	blood pressure	decreased bp	"After three to four day started experiencing diarrhea and abdominal pain.  The abdominal pain increased in severity over several days, starting in lower GI and moving up to include mid and upper abdomen.  The drug was stopped for a few weeks.  Thinking the GI pain may have been caused by a GI ""bug"", the lisinopril was restarted with the same reaction after two to three days.  Drug discontinued."	"""Gradually dry cough increased to heavy coughing especially at night after one week of taking"""
773	naproxen	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	juvenile idiopathic arthritis	The treatment did not affect the level of joint pain that I experienced, nor did it improve joint stiffness. I cannot comment on it's effect on inflammation as my inflammation tends not to be visible anyway. <i This may be the reason that Naproxen did not benefit me</i	Caused nausea and stomach pain. The nausea would alleviate a couple of hours before the next dose was due, and start within an hour of the dose. It did not cause actual vomitting, but there were a few occasions on which I felt so nauseous I was convinced I would be sick at any moment.	I would never take Naproxen again without having a LONG discussion with both a doctor and pharmacist.

The side effect that I get is metallic taste in mouth / tingles in my tongue towards my bottom teeth and loss of appetite ( which is common to me on any arthritis medications and ever since I got arthritis in the first place ) and feeling slightly sick after I take the pills. The drug definitely has had a positive effect on my pain levels though and has even led to a reduction in my overall meds . I&#039;m feeling much better then I used to and am able to work and have a pretty normal life again."""
2815	wellbutrin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Lifting of mood.	No noticeable side-effects from the brand name, problems with generic.  Details in next section.	"I began taking Wellbutrin about 3 years ago.  At some point, I realized the generic was available and switched to it.  I did not anticipate any difference in effectiveness or side effects as I thought the generic was chemically identical to the brand, minus the ink used to print ""Wellbutrin"" on the pills.  It took about a month before I thought switching to the generic might even be related to the onset of irritability and subjective experience of ""heart pounding.""  I switched back to the name brand and the negative side effects disappeared almost immediately.  Also during the period of irritability (and pulse increase, I think, but I didn't actually take my pulse), I had a blood vessel burst in my hand.  This was not a surface capillary, but a deep vessel, that caused a bruise to appear on both sides of my hand.  The bursting was not associated with any trauma to the hand, but seemed rather spontaneous."

1766	prochlorperazine	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	nausea	i was experiencing nausea without vomiting. The doctor prescribed stemetil 3x daily.  The first day the nausea was largely alleviated by the taking the stemetil.	The second day of taking stemetil i began to experience unpleasant anxiety and a  cramping sensation in my muscles, particularly my arms. This worsened throughout the day and I found myself uncontrollably flexing my muscles and not being able to control it.	"""Read the side effects carefully. I had a severe distonic reaction and had to spend the day in the emergency room after just 1 pill. I have been advised by my doctor to never even take anything in this family of medicines."""
3037	seroquel	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety/mild ptsd	Stopped the constant racing thoughts at night.  Finally could get some decent sleep.  Before I'd lay in bed for hours on end thinking and thinking over and over until I was nuts.  Now am able to sleep an entire night through with less paranoia to boot...	grogginess in the AM, definitely.  Have to take some kind of caffeine pill to get going otherwise, I am a zombie.  I have a job where I have to be 100% focused all day, and it's difficult getting out of the morning fog sometimes.	I know there are issues with weight gain.  Because of the sedative effects, this makes natural sense.  I would advise people to try to incorporate as much exercise in their daily lives as possible to combat the weight gain.  Also, if you typically take the drug at night, as I do, try not to eat at least 3 hours before bedtime.  This is hard, but I have learned it is a small sacrifice so I feel more mentally stable.
1485	cymbalta	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dystimia	"When you are in a mild depression or dystimia the worst thing is that you are unable to think or concentrate, you feel sleep and tired all the day. It's like 
having a permament cloud in your mind. I think that this treatment is helping me a lot: now I have a sharper mind, I feel more energetic and I can concentrate properly."	The most annoying side side is insomnia and tremor. I take deprax to induce sleep but even with it I woke up very early. You can get used to some side effects like dry mouth, vivid dreaming and weight loss but tremor, although not serious, is very noticeable. I experienced delayed ejaculation at the begining but not now.	The treatment consists of Cymbalta 60mg and Deprax 50 mg, but it has been changed many times. The most difficult has been to induce sleep for some hours without feeling too sleepy in the morning. I tried with Loramet and Diazepam but their effect last too much, it's impossible to concentrate. Deprax 100mg is the best I've taken to sleep. Now I'm taking just 50mg and I don't fall sleep so quick but it's fine, I have enough rest.
3642	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sun damage to skin	Retin-A smoothed out my skin and reduced fine lines. It particularly helped the kind of lines that radiate from the corner of my eyes down my cheeks.  They virtually disappeared, and people remarked within a few months that I looked healthier, less tired, and younger.  I was happy with the results of using this product.	Irritated skin, dry skin. When I first started using this product, they gave me a weaker strength and I gradually was given stronger formulas as my skin got used to it.  The only problem was that if I used a little too much, even later as my skin was used to the formula, I would wake up with red skin that looked like a sunburn.  I eventually moved to using topical ascorbic acid instead of Retin-A, which works well and doesn't cause the skin irritation.	I spread a dab or two of the cream on my face at night before sleeping.  It took several weeks to acclimate to the cream. It did improve the appearance of my skin. I noticed that it also made what the dermatologist called pre-cancerous spots disappear (these were a couple of small spots that the doctor wanted to treat with topical vitamin A).
747	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nasal allergies	It cleared up my nasal allergies, my stuffy nose, post nasal drip and as an added benefit it also helped prevent getting hoarse.	There were no side effects, but I was careful to only use it when needed and not to use it for more than 1 month at a time.	I would use as directed for the first few weeks, then cut the dose in half for maintenance.  It take about a day and a half to start working and about 3 days to work fully.
608	minocin	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	I have been struggling with adult acne. A dermatologist prescribes the Minocycline and for the first two months, it worked great. I had perfectly clear skin AND I noticed that my hair STOPPED falling out at it's normal rate. All the women in my family start losing their hair starting in their thirties and by the time they are 60, wigs are definitely in order. Also, I normally get tonsil stones. These also ceased.	No major side effects other than it stopped working for my acne after two months so I stopped taking it.  The acne has become worse than ever.  The hair loss returned although at a somewhat diminished rate than pre-Minocycline. The one remaining benefit is that the tonsil stones have not returned. It has been approximately one month since I discontinues use of the antibiotic.	"""I used this medicine for less than a week.  It really improved my skin but I had some bad side effects which included being dizzy and light-headed.  I also had stomach cramps and very bad diarrhea.  I tried taking it with and without food."""
2473	enbrel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	ankylosing spondylitis	Little improvement for first week or so but then incredible turnaround. Went from regularly not being able to walk properly due to inflamed sacroiliac joints and general back pain and flu-like aches across whole body most days to a new woman! After 3 months have noticed the last couple of weeks some of the aches and pains starting to come back slightly towards end of the week but overall extremely positive.

642	seasonique	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	Fewer periods, a big plus for any woman.	Spotting between periods (started off heavy like a period, but lightened up as time progressed), breast tenderness (do to fluid build-up),  breasts became larger in size (once more, do to fluid build-up), and bloating.	Although the beginning stages of taking the pill were somewhat uncomfortable, Seasonique has remained a staple in modern birth control.  I would suggest this medication to any woman that is tired of dealing with a period every month (which is the majority of us).  The only thing that you need to keep an eye on, besides taking the pill everyday, is when its time for your cycle ITS THERE!  Even though you're on the pill does not mean you still can't get pregnant.  Take tests every three weeks to ensure there are no surprises in store for you.
795	ambien	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	restless sleep	Is very helpful with insomnia.  Was able to put racing thoughts that run threw my mind at rest.  Was able to get into a deep sleep.	Could still wake up in  middle of the night and not be able to fall back asleep. I would sometimes fell groggy in the morning, especially at the begaining stage.  It seems as if the effectivness starts to wear off with continued use.	I take 1 pill everynight before bed as needed.  Sometimes I could quit taking it when my sleep cycle was normal.
2341	propecia	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	thinning hair		Severely decreased libido, brain fog/mental blankness, muscle weakness, impotence, penile shrinkage.	Given 1mg Propecia for ~one week in 10/05, noticed instant compromise of sexual capacity and an increase in anxiety & confusion. Stopped because of this experience, however did not completely regain libido, sexual function or mental sharpness as promised. Tried treatment again two years later thinking my experience was normal and would subside with continued use (as indicated in drug info), until the same exact thing happened. I researched the symptoms and learned I was not alone thanks to propeciahelp.com, I stopped once again and have strived to reverse the damages since to no avail.

"Cannot take a birth control pill for more than ~24 months without side effects arising (i.e. mood swings, bowel change, spotting which was not present when I first started the medication, etc.)  Seasonale is just the next medication to take until I can save enough money and/or convince my insurance company to pay for a hysterectomy.  

I have been on birth control for 12 years to control irregular cycles (imagine 50 day cycle followed by 15 day cycle) and intense PMS symptoms.  I have recently developed Raynaud's and am increasingly worried about my fibrinogen levels due to birth control (specifically contraceptives containing estrogen such as Seasonale and every other birth control pill I've ever been on).  

I should also mention, I eat well at least 85% of the time (fast food/greasy take-out maybe once every other week) and exercise (combo of yoga, pilates, cardio, weightlifting) at least three days a week."	"""This is the first birth control I have tried, and so far I love it. I&#039;m heading into my third week being on this pill and so far I have experienced very minimal side effects, something I did not expect after reading such horror stories about this pill and others similar to it. I have had no spotting yet (fingers crossed this continues). The most noticeable side effect thus far has been breast tenderness. Its not unbearable-and usually an Advil helps-but they&#039;re definitely more sore than usually. This tends to vary by day as well. I haven&#039;t noticed any severe change in my mood, maybe a little more sensitive than normal, and definitely no change in my sex drive. I am loving this pill so far! Hopefully these side effects continue to be minimal."""
1885	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	perioral dermatitis	There was a persistent area of blister like bumps on lower face similar to acne but without resolution.  With this treatment, the bumps disappeared and didn't return for one year.	Slight nausea if not taken with food.  No other side effects were noted.	Topical and oral antifungals and anti virals were tried.  Additionally, topical corticosteroids were attempted with no results.  Within days of beginning the doxycycline, the rash began to disappear and didn't return for almost a year.  Again the cycle began a year later with immediate start of doxycycline and the same results as the previous year.  I understand that peri oral dermatitis is not uncommon in women of my age and is thought to be hormone and stress related, much like acne in adolecents.
3550	cardura-xl	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bph	Increased urinary flow w/o the side effects of Flomax (decreased erectile strength). Available strengths are more varied with Cardura, thus effectiveness can be achieved with minimal dosage.	"None with Cardura. I switched from Flomax because the minimum dosage of 4 mg reduced libido and erectile strength. Not completely, but ""half-mast"" so to speak."	1 2mg tablet at night.

Must be taken at night or when you don't need to perform (such as on long flights)."	Take Xanax an hour before an anxiety inducing situation, or at night to reduce panic/anxiety attacks until the Lexpro kicked in (about a month).

1786	citalopram	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Some symptoms of depression - crying all the time, dark thoughts - were lessened, although hard to know how much benefit the treatment gave all told or whether I would have come through it anyway as I had in the past.	"When started on treatment: vivid images when eyes closed, trembling, anxiety, feeling of detachedness
Throughout treatment: Insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns, some dizziness at times, muscular twitching, fidgeting and spasming, weight loss due mostly to fidgeting all the time

239	wellbutrin-xl	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression, fatigue	Wellbutrin XL made a real difference in my life.  I had a tendency to get unnerved and anxious at the smallest things and since taking Wellbutrin, my husband has noticed a huge difference in my disposition.  I was not a majorly depressed person, just mildly depressed and fatigued, and also becoming uninterested in activities that I used to enjoy.  Wellbutrin definitely made me feel happier and more interested in life. As far as the rumor goes of Wellbutrin enhancing sexual desire - I have not noticed a diffence in myself in that regard.	I have to take the pill at night.  If I take the pill in the morning, I notice that I get a headache about 2p.	I take 300mg once a day and I've been on Wellbutrin for 2 years now and my doctor said there is no reason to stop taking it.

Since then I have slept only for about 12 hours (in six days), a nauseous feeling in my stomach with dizziness, stomach cramps, a permanent knot in my stomach, shivers, tremors and sweats, I am worried about itching starting  now.  The good news is that I am less fuzzy in my head even though I am tired, my bladder control is back and I seem to be losing some of the 3/4 stones I have gained since taking the drug.

2324	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	general depression/perimenopause	Started taking this drug for two reasons - peri-menopausal symptoms (mood swings) and depression experienced after going through hurricane Katrina. After 2-3 weeks of starting, noticed my temperament was much more even and felt better able to cope with daily stress and stay motivated.	Fortunately, none for me. I know this type of drug can cause sexual side effects and weight gain, but I have had no issues here. The only thing I noticed was the very first week I took it I was a bit sleepy/groggy during the day, but this went away once I adjusted.	Started out with a very low dose, 5mg/day for the first month, then moved up to 10 mg/day which is my present dose. The full dose is actually 20mg/day, but I feel I am getting the results I need with 10mg, so there is no need to increase the dosage and risk any adverse side effects.
2699	detrol-la	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	overactive bladder	Greatly improved the sense of urgency. I usually had to urinate every 20-30 minutes. Now I can go as long a 2-3 hours. I find I need to take it as soon as I get up for the best results.  If I wait I have a morning of running to the bathroom. I used to get up around 3-4 times a night and now get up only once.	None of the side effects that are usually mentioned.  However, I do now have restless legs at night which I have not mentioned to my dr yet.  I hadn't thought it was related to the detrol until I saw on another post that someone else was complaining of restless legs at night after taking detrol? So I will mention it to my dr. because it is very annoying. The only other side effect is some drowsiness in the afternoons but it does pass.	I had been suffering for years with an overactive bladder but had never brought it up to my dr. until our daughter was getting married in Jamaica and I just knew I could never make it without some help.  Doctor gave me sample and I saw improvement and tolerate it well so I have been on it ever since.

One day I just could not get out of bed - the depression was so bad that my father took me to the doctor who handed me a sample pack provided to him by a drug rep. The Effexor was a life saving medication.	I did experience some  taking ignificant side effects as a result of taking effexor. THese included major sexual disfunction, chrinic tireness, apathy  and a numb state of being. I felt that the medication made me feel like I was just zombing through work and social life.

I will get a slight headache, a few hours after I take the drug. Usually not bad enough that it's actually painful, just annoying.	I take the diazepam about 1.5 hours before the plan takes off.

Since taking it, the flashes and mood swings disappeared.  I have been on hormaone therapy for about 20 years and have no intention of going off.

I had to go and be evaluated by an opthalmologist, family practioner, and a neurologist since they thought my blurred vision was a result of something else. I was prescribed glasses, had to have extensive testing and FINALLY after 3-1/2 weeks, my normal vision return. I contacted the pharmacy, the drug manufacturer, the FDA and a toxicologist and none were able to tell me how long the side effects would last. I am grateful to have my sight back but this drug should not be on the market if even only 1& of the population can have visual disturbances...It was hell to not see clearly and have to submit to so many tests and be so dependent on others for getting around. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!	
2034	protonix	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	possible ulcer and acid reflux	Heartburn/Acid reflux stopped the first day I took it. I haven't had any issues with heartburn or acid reflux whatsoever. Stomach pain (from possible ulcer-haven't had results back from test to diagnose that) has decreased significantly.	No side effects that I know of, however my father (who also takes protonix) had to discontinue his regimen for a week because of a test he had to have done said his acid reflux came back about 2 days after he stopped and it was 10x worse than it was before treatment. I guess this isn't a drug one should go off of completely.	I pill a day and all has been well. =D
3880	abilify	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	I didn't notice any benefit at all. Supposedly, it was to help keep my mood balanced.  More than anything, I was focused on the very apparent and prevalent side effects.	A very uncomfortable inner restlessness was the worst side effect.  I felt like I had to constantly get up and move around, but it didn't even help.  I couldn't sit still, had major problems sleeping at night, AND started gaining weight.

3060	oxycodone	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	possible lymphoma/kidney pain	The drug was pretty good for pain. They had me on morphine, which was horrible. The pain was preferable to the crazy dreams and paranoia I had. They then tried oxycontin, which was the best pain drug they gave me, but too addictive... so they moved me to vicodin products, which worked pretty well, with surprisingly few side effects.	Sleepiness, dizziness, light-headedness & nausea. I only took them when the pain was unbearable, so I might have gotten used to the side effects if I had kept the levels up in my system.	I just took the pills every 4-6 hours when the kidney pain was too bad. I tried to only take them at night as the conditions improved since they made me sleep. I stopped takeing them long before the infections and colon problems were resolved, as I don't like takeing drugs.

Vaginal irritation, decreased sexual desire, constant yeast infections	Within the first two weeks that I started using Nuvaring my sexual desire decreased and it became very difficult to get aroused.  This had never happened to me before and as soon as I stopped using the ring it became easier to get aroused.  I also had constant yeast infections while taking this drug.  Before I started Nuvaring I had never in my life had one.  While on it, I must have had at least six.  I have been off of the ring now for three months and have not had one.  Although I have seen few people make this claim, I swear that there is a connection.

There were no discernible side effects. I took the drug for a year and i did not notice any side effects or changes after I stopped taking the drug.	I had High cholesterol and was considered to be at risk for heart attack. This drug was supposed to lower my cholesterol level which would reduce any heart plaque that might be building up in my arteries. I lowered my cholesterol somewhat but ultimately my diet did much more to change my counts.

When the dose of Effexor XR got high enough, I felt for the first time what it was like to be ""normal"" - happy, sad, etc. without the overbearing feeling of depression.  When I had to go off the Effexor XR due to cost, the depression recurred.  This drug literally changed my life.  However, when I talk to other people who were not helped by it, they frequently are on a very low dose.  I am glad that I found a doctor willing to prescribe a high enough dose to be beneficial."
1118	effexor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The numbness in my arms and hands significantly reduced. I was having uncontrollable emotions of sadness, crying and even thoughts of suicide.  Taking the effexor helped me not only control my emotions but also diminished the intensity as well.	Initally when I started taking Effoxor it upset my stomach. I was taking in the morning after breakfast so the Dr. suggested taking it before bedtime which solved that problem.  I have been taking it for sometime now and do not remember any other side effects from this mediation.	I started off taking 50mg for two weeks then increased the dosage to 75mg for two weeks.  After visiting the Dr. after a month on this dosage he recommended going up to 100mg and eventually I increased it to 150mg.  This is currently the dosage I am taking.

The Luvox stopped all ruminations and obsessive worry, while the generic fluvoxamine seemed to do nothing, and did not help with sleep.	Some vague nausea, which was not a problem with the name brand drug.	"""My psychiatrist prescribed me Luvox 100mg that I&#039;ve been on for close to 2 months to help me deal with symptoms of stress and social anxiety.  I would say the medication works but the side effects aren&#039;t worth me continuing it so I&#039;m going to see about something else that is proven to have less side effects.  Some of the side effects I was experiencing were difficulty staying asleep and waking up with night sweats, dry mouth, and sore throat.  I think Zoloft worked better for me."""

The side effects at first were that if she didnt take it the pain would come back.   She was eventually diagonsed with large cell carcinoma of the lungs.  She had an exam before taking celebrix and was clear but after 2 years of taking it she had cancer. whilst in hospital she learnt that fellow patients also taking the same medication also developed large cell arcinoma of the lungs. Is it a coincidene i may ask?.I also remember she was short of breath.	"""What a JOKE!  Doesn&#039;t do anything unless you count the side effects!

This MAY work for some, or it may be a placebo effect, but for me it did nothing but add to my problems!   Doctors also need to consider QUALITY of life over QUANTITY.

After two weeks of taking Celebrex I was able to walk easier but I feel the progress was due to staying off the leg and keeping it elevated. Celebrex did absolutely nothing for the intense pain.

Before use, it seemed my nose/sinuses were clogged on & off and made me much more susceptible to colds/flu--as much as 4 to 5 times per year & lasting 10 days to 2 weeks each round.  I was miserable.  Nasacort keeps my nasal passages open--it's a wonder!!	No side effects noticed.	1 to 2 sprays per nostril per day.

I have to say that I have gotten rid of my pigmentation. My skin is very smooth and it also takes cate of ocassional breakout. My pore size has become smaller.	Side effects are not negligible. I feel my skin has become profusely sensitve.I feel intense heat on particular areas of my face when I am out in the afternoon , even thopugh I am stanidng in the shade..

1704	retin-a-micro	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne - blackheads and acne scars	Blackheads are gone. Pores on my cheeks are noticeably smaller. Acne scars faded. Skin looks more polished.	A few days a week, my face would be red, very sensitive, and peeling. Then it would be back to normal and then a few days later the peeling starts again.	I use this drug to help with the overall appearance of my skin, especially blackheads, pore size, and acne scars. I don't have any wrinkles, so I can't comment on how well it worked for that. But hopefully it is preventing wrinkles from ever developing. I only use it twice a week now coz my skin is very sensitive. Once I get more used to the drug, I will slowly increase the frequency. During the first two weeks of use, I didn't really notice any changes except that my skin was drier and started to peel a little. By the third week, I started seeing my blackheads disappearing and my pores changing. They actually looked bigger. Then after 2 months of continued usage, my pores got smaller, acne scars faded and blackheads are almost completely gone. Few days a week I would have red, irritated peeling skin. But nothing extremley terrible or intolerable. With good moisturizer and calming face creams, I'm able to minimize my peeling to a point where it doesn't bother me that much. I've heard that Retin-A takes awhile to work and see results, but I've already seen positive changes in less than 6 months. I can't wait to find out the long-term benefits it will have on my skin, especially after I start increasing the frequency and concentration.

I spoke with my doctor and he advised me that such side effects, although very uncommon, almost always wore off after the first few months.  I decided to stick it out and sure enough, they wore off as my body grew accustomed to the medication.	"""I&#039;m very happy with Seasonique.  I had my tubes tied about a year and a half ago after the birth of my 3rd son.  I have very bad PMS and very painful ovulation.  I could not take being miserable 3 weeks out of the month any more so my doctor put me on Seasonique.  I found that my face is clearer and my appetite less. Only down side is lack of sex drive.

It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes.	"A total loss of any sexual sensation.  Prior to treatment interest in sex was low but paradoxically, when a feeling of psychological well-being produced a renewed interest in sex, the drug also removed the physical ability to engage in it.  Orgasm was impossible and physical arousal was too weak to be effective. 
The worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  Every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  Throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement."	"""I take 30 mg a day. My only complaint is embarresing but I&#039;m having trouble with have orgasms. The desire is still there but my husband has to work real hard! I use to be &quot;Easy&quot;. Now there is no such thing as a &quot;Quicky&quot;. I spoke to my doctor and he says when my unchangeable life evets calm down he can swithch me to Effexor XR which is suppose to be better. We&#039;ll see."""
240	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The Wellbutrin with 20 mg of Prozac daily as an adjunct alleviated most symptoms of depression.  Better sleep as a result, and more energy throughout the day.	Jitters, trembling hands.	I had been taking Prozac with other medications for 10 years and it had stopped working for me.  After being prescribed Wellbutrin with it, I found I felt so much better.  However, when I tried to stop taking Prozac entirely and stay just on the Wellbutrin, my depression returned.  I have been on this cocktail now for 5 years and believe it has helped me immensly.
1160	zofran	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nausea	no nausea, less vomiting.  able to get through work and school feeling better	mild dizziness, sometimes I would get a headache	I was prescribes 4 mg zofran to take 4 times per day for relief of nausea and vomiting which was most likely due to vertigo.  I had a decrease in the nausea symptoms after the first dose, and had total relief after about 3 doses.  i did experience a mile headache, which I believe is common for this drug

2759	xenical	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	contraception	contraception	For some reason i felt very emotional, much more than before going on the pill. It did not come across as a negative side effect, but I would  cry  on seeing a scenic landscape, not to mention more charged situation.   Similar side effects were described by my friend who also took marvelon.  Moreover, I experienced enhanced libido but, perhaps, it was an effect of reduced worrying over getting pregnant.	I took it daily with with 7-day break each month, during which a period was induced.

3789	keflex	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pre-surgery	I was prescribed Keflex to take as a precaution to prevent infection prior to a scheduled surgery.  I took if for several days before and after the surgery.	This drug gave me very strange dreams.	I was instructed to take Keflex 3 times a day, or it might have been 4, but that I did not have to wake myself up at night to take it.
1217	prozac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"Before taking Prozac I had no energy or joy - I could barely lift my head off the pillow in the morning. I just wanted to stay in bed. When I first started taking it, I could feel it physically - I felt a little ""giddy"" and my eyes felt/looked glazed. But over time, those feelings went away and I just felt normal. I no longer felt like I was on a drug - I just felt good. I could get up in the morning and looked forward to each day."	I had very vivid dreams/nightmares the entire time I took it. Eight years later, I can still remember many of them and the way they made me feel. I gained weight (from 115lbs to 130lbs).	"""If it wasn&#039;t for Prozac SSRI, I wouldn&#039;t be able to function normally; probably just lie in bed and not know what to do... Long story short, this drug is a God send. I&#039;m not even on a high dose but I can feel that it&#039;s helping me get back on my feet and live. My goal is that this will help not only live again, but stronger."""
712	accutane	5	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	cystic acne	The drug cleared my skin and even reduced some of the redness and scarring from the acne.  This was my first and last treatment.	severe sexual side effects began about 2 months into the trial including pain during intercourse, soreness lasting as long as 24 hours followed by periods as long as 2 weeks or more where intercourse was impossible due to intense pain upon penetration, vaginal dryness, and the inability to have a vaginal orgasm.  I also had overall skin dryness, but using a daily moisturizer and medicated chapstick made this very manageable.	treatment began with two 40mg tablets twice a day, but was reduced to once a day after the first month due to extremely dry skin.  When sexual side effects began in month 2, my dermatologist suggested using a personal lubricant during sex (which was never needed before treatment began) and that the problem would clear up once I was finished with the treatment. I began the treatment in Febuary 2007 and finished September 2007.  The problem with dry skin cleared up rapidly, but I continue to struggle with the sexual side effects (as of June 2008).  I have been treating the vaginal dryness with an over the counter product called Replens since January 2008 and this has helped considerably, but it causes constant vaginal discharge. I am now able to have sex about once ever 2-4 weeks, but have yet to experience a vaginal orgasm.
406	restasis	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	dry eyes	Restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.  There was a short period where I ran out of restasis and stopped, after about a week the dry eye symptoms had reappeared, only to do away when I resumed treatment.	there were not any side effects.	1-2 eye drops twice a day
2787	wellbutrin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression-anxiety	Benefits included decreased anxiey attacks.  It took approximately 2 weeks to see results but after that time it was a noticable difference.	The main side effect is dizziness.  For example just sitting and then the room begins to spin.  This only began to happen when I started the medication.  Also I would not advise stopping the medication all of a sudden.  When this happened I began to have terrible headaches, became very dizzy and moody even more so than when I began the medication.	The plan for this treatment was to decrease the frequency and intensity of anxiety attacks.  Medication combined with counseling has helped improve the situation.  When I went off the medication it was only for a short period of time and then I realized it was necessary to go back onto the medication because of the benefits.
3281	zoloft	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	Emotions were somewhat blunted. Less moodiness.	Weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy.	"I was on Zoloft for about 2 years total. I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 

The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 

I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life."
3128	cytomel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	when the standard treatment for hypothyroid didn't work to raise my baseline t3 & t4 levels, i continued to experience all of the low thyroid symptomsA:  coldness, lethargic, depression, etc.  by taking cytomel on the 5 x daily basis, i have very close to normal functioning thyroid activity.	the effects are good, if I took all at once as originally prescribed i got too jittery and hot initially, followed by a bit of a crash.  the way to do it is throughout the day in the smaller dose.	I'm not quite sure what you mean.  but my treatment is once a day levoxyl prescription and 5 times a day cytomel prescription.  I have annual blood work and see an endicrinologist now only one time every two years.  although i had seen him initially much more frequently.
3009	cipro	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	urinary tract infection	After starting treatment with Cipro, I almost immediate improvement of my condition, and the pain was severely lessened.	I felt some dizziness and fatigue, but there were no clear side effects that were directly attributable to the drug.	After beginning treatment, I saw improvement within 2 days, and the urinary tract infection cleared up within 3-4 days.  I continued for another couple days to make sure it was gone for good.
1627	premarin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	vaginal dryness	improved vaginal lubrication, decreased sensitivity, improved urinary continence, improved urethral tone,	some breakthrough bleeding/spotting at the once a day dosage after fourteen days, very intermittent, did not persist after dose reduced to twice weekly.	Medicine was inserted vaginally  once daily at bedtime for the first 2 weeks; patient abstained from sexual intercourse during that time so that male partner would not be exposed to the effects of estrogen.
3823	flovent	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	having suffered from asthma for most of my adult life, I began to rely on the albuterol (which should be only used as a rescue inhaler) multiple time per day.  After beginning the Flovent inhaler, my asthma was almost non-existent.	It lists that mouth ulcers may occur, but upon following the instructions which say to rinse out the mouth directly after taking the medicine, I have suffered no side effects.	"""Works great as a rescue inhaler.  Fast acting. Inexpensive"""
849	ritalin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	narcolepsy	No longer fell asleep at inappropriate and dangerous times. For the first time in my adult life I was able to concentrate. I was able to effectively work and study.	Extreme fatigue when not taking ritalin such as on the weekend. Sometimes I was so fatigued, taking ritalin was unable to keep me awake. When I used ritalin during the day at work, it reduced my inhibitions in social and business situations and I would blurt out things before I had the chance to internally filter them. Experienced periods of sleeplesness at night.	I would set the alarm for 6am, take ritalin, go back to sleep until 7am. This gave the ritalin time to kick in so I could feel awake when I arose. Just after lunch I would take a 2nd dose of ritalin 20mg SR to keep me awake and able to concentrate through the afternoon.
3083	minocycline	4	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	acne	No change in acne despite 15 days of usage -- probably antibiotic resistant.	Upset stomach, headache. Nausea could be combatted with ingestion of yogurt.	"""Another side effect- extreme itching."""

After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry.

This is aggravated by my smoking as well."	The drug was considerably free of side effects. Though i don't know whether this was due to the drug, but i did get sleepy more often than usual.	"As mentioned,I have a recurring sinus problem wherein my nasal passages get blocked and throat and vocals are affected.
This is aggravated by my smoking as well.
I started taking allegra and saw that my condition improved slowly but steadily over the course of two weeks and by the end of that time period i was back to normal. The only noticeable side effects experienced by me were more sleep and drowsiness at times."

3721	lamictal	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar ii	lifted depression, calmed violent mood swings	I've been lucky with side effects. It has been entirely weight-neutral, which was a big consideration for me. I had some very pleasant side effects when I first started taking the drug--vivid but enjoyable dreams and an increase in sexuality. The only negative effects were sometimes having to reach to find the word I was trying to use (which has since lessened, although it still happens occasionally) and pretty bad acne (which I am now treating separately and is much better.) Neither of those effects are on the PI sheet, and my doctor seems very skeptical that either was caused by the drug, but I've found lots of anecdotal evidence of other people experiencing similar things. Regardless, the effects have been minimal and WELL worth it considering how much I've been helped.	"I started treatment when I was in what seemed like a mixed state--barely able to leave my bed at times, having to go into the bathroom at work to cry nearly every day, having strong urges to self-mutilate, and having a lot of suicidal ideation. I was also very agitated and angry, lashing out at loved ones for seemingly no reason. Lamotrigine started lifting the depression almost immediately, and once I hit the theraputic dose of 200 mg, it was like a cloud lifted overnight. I still have some ups and downs, but nothing major, and even when destructive thoughts cross my mind, I'm able to push them away more easily.

I have recently had a rather intense relapse into bulimia, but I doubt that's related to the lamotrigine either way."

I encountered no physical side effects, however I did have trouble with insomnia after I discontinued the treatment. It was more difficult to fall asleep after discontinuation than before treatment began. I consider this to be a mark of addiction.	dosage taken at bedtime caused extreme tiredness. slept through the night, woke in the morning without unusual grogginess, but the treatment was somewhat addictive, I thought.

I stopped with crestor and after 1 week; no more leg pain, i can walk again, no more tight feelings in my feet. NO MORE CRESTOR!	"used tablets for 2 1/2 years, did not realise that the cramps after 1 year could be a side effect so i kept on taking the tablets, still didn't realize it when i got these enormous swollen legs. 
By the way Ezetrol gives me dizzyness (vertigo) so I chucked him away too."
2092	selegiline	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	attention deficit problems, concentration difficul	During the first two weeks no notable benefits, but after that there was a distinct difference; the brain fog seemed to have disappeared, general mental state and motivation improved. However, there was no significant change as to the ability to concentrate which continued to be as poor as before. On doctor's advice the dosage was increased to 20mg per day but due to side-effects on that dose had to return to the previous dose (10mg daily)	On the larger dosage of 20mg per day: dizziness, rapid heart rate, general feeling  of nausea	"""EMSAM greatly helped the depression and anxiety.  I had energy and a life again.  But I had insomnia very hard to treat.  I tried Ambien, Lunesta, Seroquel, Ativan and Trazodone but nothing helped.  My Psychiatrist suggested Chloral Hydrate.  """
3894	dispermox	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	The benefits of amoxicillin were that it did help clear the infection, it seemed to help my acne, also.  I noticed it working within about four days.  I only had to take it for a week.  It did not taste bad.  It did not make me foggy headed.	the amoxicillin gave me some gastrointestinal upset.  After a few days, I had mild diarrhea.  It caused a vaginal yeast infection.  After the regimen was over, I felt more tired that usual.  I think the natural flora in my body was altered and somehow made me feel more tired.  I have taken this medication several times for different infections.  I was concerned about resistance.	The amoxicillin was given in 500mg pill form 3 times daily for one week. It was inconvenient to have to take the medicine every 8 hours, but the physician recommended this time frame in order to keep the blood levels at a helpful level.  It meant having to wake up in the middle of the night to take it.
1874	doxycycline	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	acne	Controlled acne breakouts to some extent when on drug.		Took Doxylin 50 mg once daily for 3 months.  Improved acne during that time.  However after stopping treatment. Acne came back.  Was also using oil-free based cleanser twice daily at the time.  Avoided oily foods, ate heaps of fruit and veg.
1059	oracea	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	The treatment cleared up papules and pustules (not completely, but significantly) and decreased redness in the face.	Yeast infections, stomach upset, fatigue. Strangely enough, it was only after coming off of antibiotics that I developed deep cystic acne. Before I had many small papules/pustules, but they were never very deep. After the antibiotics, the number I would have on my face at one time decreased, but I developed cysts deep under the surface of the skin that would sit there for weeks (never happened before).	Eventually stopped taking Oracea because of the yeast infections. The long-term use of this and other antibiotics seems to have affected my immune system negatively.

But this has been ok to deal with because my head finally felt right. I was able to go off of my anti-anxiety medication some years ago. After all this time on Cymbalta I have gone through some major life changes in the last year and my anxiety has come back. My depression has been sneaking back as well. I am trying CBT with a little success. I think I may need an increased dose or may have to try something new, which I dread."""
3763	spironolactone	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	facial hair	Hair loss. Helps hair follicles become less sensitive to protestosterone.	She had minimal hair loss on face and unwanted body areas and increased hair on head.	She had had testing done for high levels of testosterone which were sometimes average sometimes average-high (5.0). So it was not that she had too much testosterone, it was the way her hair folicles were responding to it. With this treatment you must be careful to get plenty of electrolytes in body. Also most effective if taken with birth control.
1797	citalopram	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major depressive disorder/ anxiety	I was unable to get out of bed or see my friends. I hated going out to parties, going to class, or just interacting with people in general. After taking Celexa I found myself jumping out of bed in the morning and feeling ready to start my day. I started going out more on the weekends and my grades improved significantly. I was happy again and I felt like my life was getting back to how it was before I became depressed.	For the first month I had considerable nausea and headaches but those went away. The lasting effects however were dry mouth and dry eyes. I do experience the initial side effects whenever I increase my dose. I have also lost a lot of weight, about 15 pounds, due to the nausea and food aversion I experience from this medication.	My psychiatrist put me on a low dose in October 2009 (20mg) which increased to 40 mg in two months. I am now currently taking 50 mg and it is working great.
1565	lortab	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sever back pain,	Helped some what to control the pain from a disk setting on my siatic nerve. It did not stop the pain but it did help lesson the amount of pain so I could function better.	I think it is more of a long term side affect that happened, In the corse of the years I took this product I started experencing decrease sensation in my lower bowl, to the point I when I needed to use the bathroom, it also messed up my digestion. I quit using it and would only take it when I get so deep in pain I need to get a handle on it, the drug helps then	I was given Loritab to help stop the pain in my back and running down my left leg. I was to take it every 6 hours or as needed, which ended up using it round the clock the pain was so bad. The Doctors also gave me 600mg of Ibuprophin to take with the Loritab. It helped at fist but the end effects to my body I feel in some ways not worth taking the medication, but it it's defense it did help me get a handle on the pain so I could get off the drug

Sometimes I felt like I had drank a large cup of coffee during its full potency.	"I took modafinil for cronic fatigue and general drousiness. I found it to be moderatly effective. 

In the morning after I would take a dose the effects were noticeble and even pronounced, however after about lunchtime it totally wore off and I would have to take another dose, but if the second pill is taken later in the day it sometimes would interfere with sleep so one must be carful to take the pill at the right time."

The dose was increased gradually every 2 month as my thyroid was drastically decreasing its activity and symptoms reoccured. The doses of 100 mcg and later 112 mcg were taken sublingually twice a day 30-40 minutes before breakfast and lunch.

I can't drive, or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  My narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that I do not dream at night at all.  With the provigil, along with my other medications, I am able to balance day and night and not feel like I'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Also, I don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming.	During the first week, my heart rate increased as I increased the dose, but now my heart rate is perfectly normal.  I believe it may have given me a little headache/stomach ache the first week as well, but those are gone now too.	I take my provigil every morning, 3 200mg tablets.  I am awake for about the first 4 hours, then I nap for a little while.  I am up for about 2 hours, and nap again.

My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life."	I have some difficulty sleeping (waking up in the night). Sometimes I have diarrhea, but not enough so it stops me from taking it. I have not had any weight gain, but do feel bloated sometimes. Once in awhile I get a weird high feeling which passes very quickly.	I have found  that I have to take it at night because of the sedating effect it seems to have on me, but that is not a problem. I was on 10 mg, and ramped up to 20 mg fairly quickly, which was like a shock to my body.. that 3 or 4 days were like a haze, but I stuck with it and it passed. I am on it for almost 4 months now and I am feeling much more like myself.
1377	biaxin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	pneumonia	Along with the tamiflu, pretty much cleared up any problems I had except for my cough. It was not as bad as a cough, but was still present. It took about 2 days for the medication to actually work but it does a good job.	Metallic taste in mouth, back pain, and headache (only for a few days). Nothing sleeping can't sure.	Went to my infirmary at my college, and was prescribed biaxin and tamiflu for my flu-like symptoms and pneumonia. Told to take both tamiflu and biaxin until finished (10 days for biaxin, 5 for tamiflu).
3002	cipro	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pneumonia	By the 5th day, I was feeling much better.	I am female. Taking this drug caused me to get a yeast infection.	2 times a day for 10 days.
1478	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	major depression	"Cymbalta got me out of a major depression.  I am still taking it.  It also relieved my back pain for about 6 months but that good effect has diminished.  While I still am not the happiest camper, I am able to function normally.  I was not able to function before the cymbalta.  When I first got on it, I had extreme fatigue for several days and some ""electric jolts""  when I was lying down.  However, that side-effect has gone.  It also causes some constipation, which is something I've rarely experienced!  I eat a very high-fiber diet but even so I'm not my ""normal"" regular self.   I'm writing this because of all the negative things I've read online.  If I had read them before I started the cymbalta I would not have gone it.  I'm happy I did not read anything!  I now feel that these reviews are written by  people with miserable results, or people who are incredibly impatient and expect and instaneous cure are the folks writing most reviews."	"I've stated most of the side-effects I had in the above paragraph.  Basically these were:

1. severe fatigue that diminished over several days.

2.  a few ""electric jolts"" that also disappeared after a couple of weeks.

3.  constipation."	I take 60 mg. once daily in the morning.
3351	lipitor	6	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesterol	"This medication is manufactured to lower the bad cholesterol levels.
Therefore it is produced to dicrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. After first month of usage the blood test should be performed . The dosage shall be adjusted accordingly and another three months treatment shall follow before another bloood test is done."	I have observed the side effects on my husband, whom I have to remind every dayto take this pill.  First of all, he felt really sick, very nausceus. He had diarrhea for about first 3 weeks of treatment and although he is very physically active because he is  a farmer, therefore he excercise most of the day, the doctor told him it was not enough, he had to excerciseeven more.	This medication was prescribed to my husband byhis doctor becasue he had shown for several years increased and then high cholesterol levels. He was presrcibed some another cholesterol lowering drug, but it was making him so sick, he asked doctor for Lipitor, because he saw a commercial on TV. First, he got 30 days supply, one pill a day, then blood test was performed and dosage adjusted, actually confirmed. It appears he has less side effects with this drug than with previous one. He shall excercise, but he is very physically active, so he does not. The blood test has shown some decrease in bad cholesterol, but not enough and the doctor insists he must excercise more, but he does not. He is due next blood test, but had no time to go there , yet. He is on this pill for about 3-4 months.

621	finacea	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne rosacea	Cleared up smaller papules/pustules and noticeably reduced facial redness. Did nothing for my cystic acne and blackheads.	"Itching on application and ten minutes after, and although it reduced redness, sometimes my face appeared a little ""too"" white after application (whiter than my neck)."	Washed face with a gentle, sulfate-free cleanser, waited 5 minutes for face to dry, then applied Finacea. Finacea only applied once a day in the morning. Waited 20 minutes after application before applying sunscreen, moisturizer, or makeup.
826	zegerid	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	I have a great reduction in stomach acid problems. When I've tried to use natural products like Alo Vera juice or licorice-based products, to take care of the problem, it is very difficult, and I have to take products throughout the day to have any success whatsoever. So taking one pill first thing in the morning holds me most of the day, though I often begin to get some acid in the evening.	As far as I can tell, there are no side effects. I have heard things about these proton inhibitors doing something to the bones, though, making for bone problems, but there's no way I can tell whether it's happening to me. My bone situation has actually improved while on this medication because I've been working out in the gym with weights.	The simplicity is one of the best features. I take the pill with a glass of water first thing in the morning, wait at least 1/2 an hour before eating anything, and I'm done!
334	neurontin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	difficulty sleeping because of nervous system prob	Helped to promote sleep without side effects, hangover or any of the other problems associated with other sleep medications.  The sleep difficulty was caused by a horrible reaction to another medication called Celexa, which appeared to sensitize my nervous system even after the Celexa was stopped.  Ever since taking the Celexa my nervous system has been exquisitely sensitive, with symptoms such as pain, heart palpitations, restless legs, and other such things that totally interrupted my ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.		Used 400-500 mg at bedtime.
1591	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic disorder	This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment.	I really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it 4-5 times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. At first, within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. Once I got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from .25 mg - 3 times per day to what I'm on now things are so stable and just smooth.	I first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. I was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. This is totally true. At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. Yes, I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. People and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just WORKS, rather than trying to give them SSRI's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons. And, the doctor's out there who decide that SSRI's are the only option, they need to go back to medical school!

"""I am 22 and I&#039;ve been taking yasmin for almost a year and it&#039;s pretty much okay, my skin is clear and cramps and PMS are a lot better than before. Side effects though are weight gain (around 13 lbs) along with bigger boobs and everything which is really not great. Also I have zero sex drive which is making me feel bad. I am thinking about switching to a lower dosage pill but I&#039;m not sure about other pills because I have migraines and I&#039;m worried it&#039;ll get worse (yasmin didn&#039;t really affect it)."""

No adverse side effects.	After reading the blogs, it's certain that we are all very different in our responses to treatment.  I had failed all the standard treatments, including high oral doses of prednisone.  I was facing a life on a ventilator with a tube in my throat.  Within a few days of starting this medication, I could breath. Actually breath.  You who have had severe asthma know how wonderful air can be. Within a week, I went for a walk.  Hadn't been able to for almost a year. No depression. Actually, I feel pretty darned happy.
697	accutane	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	When taking the Accutane I noticed a decrease in the amount of acne I had on my face over the course of the treatment.	My skin peeled greatly, praticularly around my lips and ears. I did use lotion in large amounts to combat this so it wasn't too much of a problem. I also had to stay out of the sun to avoid serious burning during the use of the drug.	I took one pill per day for 6 months, at the end of which I noticed a marked decrease in my acne. I could not get pregnant during the treatment because of the high risk of birth defects. I remained on birth control throughout the treatment.

Irritability at times and difficulty sleeping,heart palpitations and some sexual dysfunction.	I have had post-partum depression severely with each of my children.(I have 3.) In addition to the Bi-Polar disorder I have lived with most of my life. The post-partum is very scary.I knew before my 3rd child was born what I would be in for,so I was ready this time and armed with Wellbutrin.It is definitely not a cure-all, more like a bandaid,but the bandaid helped get us through the last 8 months,while being more able to work on the root of the problems through counseling.
3214	cataflam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	lower back pain	It eliminated the pain in my lower back for 8 hours at a time and after taking the full corse it seemed to have reduced the inflammation causing the pain.	I noticed no side effects, other than a one time stomach ache. This medication is associated with stomach problems when taken for longer periods, but the longest I used it was 7 days.	"""Finally found something to stop back pain. """
3395	clobex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hand dermatitis	This is the only treatment, besides cortizone shots, that had any effect.  My outbreaks consisted of opened , cracked sores (up to 9 at a time)on my fingers that were extremely painful. With a shot of cortizone every couple of years, Clobex takes care of the rest.  When I do not have an outbreak( and outbreaks are very mild if I treat them right away, I only use it a couple of times a week for prevention. I should mention that I need to be very careful and use gloves for many household cleaning tasks.	Nothing bad.

355	neurontin	3	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	neuropathic pain from botched surgery	To start with a numbness to the pain then my life was turned upside down.	My side effects were at times to many to know which ones were and are creating the most distress. I don't sleep a regular sleep, moody, depressed at times,unable to make clear decisions, dowse, memory terrible, tremor's, suppressed appetite,dry mouth, swollen legs and face, I have fevers so high I wake up saturated then in an instant all my extremities can become so cold. I feel irregular heart beat. Many times felt the rage and didn't even know where it came from let alone what my potentials were, I felt as though I was going insane, suicidal thoughts at times for two reasons. I was out of control on the meds and I felt as though my children would be better off without me. I don't handles stressful situations well.	After having gallbladder removed a nerve was cut during surgery. That created the most intense pain. I trusted the medical specialists and was in so much pain I would have done anything to make it stop. They started me on 300mg gabapentin slowly increased every 2nd day until I was taking 10,000 mg per day. yes you read it correct 10,000mg. The legal dose in NZ 3,600mg. After a serious of events and specialists adding more pain meds from codeine morphine antidepressants etc things got worse. I have been trying to decrease theses meds for two years and don't feel like I have achieved much some days. to date I take 3x 300mg 4 times a day 3,600mg (done this alone).  I have been to doctors ans specialists about side effects and feel they just dismiss them yet they come under criteria of serious side effects. I'm now the too hard basket. No help or support here with DPH or any medical facility. I have my children and Friends that help as much as they can. I desperation to come off this crap I started smoking marijuana that was more beneficial to help keep decreasing and control intense pain until recently convicted for growing my own medicine. In my opinion Gabapentin is such a dangerous drug and will be the undoing of many people. Here in NZ its all care no responsibility
1761	topamax	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	I did not experience any treatment benefits from Topamax for my severe and incapacitating migraines. I did not get relief for my migraine headaches. My migraine headaches did not stop. My migraine headaches did not decrease in duration(3 days per migraine) or intensity (severe). I had one - 3 day a week migraine for over seven years.	The Topamax treatment side effects were extreme when I was taking it.  I experienced extreme weight loss, I went from one hundred thirty pounds down to ninety eight pounds.  I experienced mental confusion and had a hard time focusing on anything including family, relationships and work.  I experienced a deep depression and had suicidal ideations that I had never before had. I also experienced loss of my word finding skills.	The treatment details for Topamax which is used to treat seizure disorders was also supposed to treat migraines are as follows.  As the patient I was to take fifty milligrams per day and was told I would lose perhaps two percent of my body weight but that after a thirty day period my migraines would decrease in intensity and decrease in duration.
685	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	"Permanently: cured of cystic acne.  Temporarily:  eliminated blackheads, smoothed skin texture, skin appeared ""poreless""."	"Dry skin and lips, increased susceptibility to developing blisters on feet if walking long distances without careful attention to socks and shoes.  Stupidly used ""Biore"" skin strips early in the treatment to speed up removal of the blackheads and pulled all the skin off my nose."	"I am 43 now but took Accutane back in my early 20's for moderate cyctic acne.  I took a second course in my 30's for mild/moderate non-cystic acne which was probably hormone related.  I absolutely loved taking Accutane and wished that I could take it again at a milder dosage to treat blackheads and have that smooth ""poreless"" skin again.  It seems to speed up skin cell sloughing and I didn't need to exfoliate, just use a good cream.  After years of taking antibiotics and using awful creams that made my skin dry and red, Accutane was a godsend.  My older brother and sister have terrible deep scars from cystic acne (my sister had dermabrasion many years ago before the age of laser) but I do not have one scar from my cyctic acne."
542	trazodone	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hard time getting asleep	Trazodone seems to help me to fall asleep faster and sleep longer. I had been having a hard time getting to sleep at night with insomia type effects. I would toss and turn and would have a hard time relaxing and would think about things that would make it hard for me to fall asleep. I started out at 200 mg, which would make me drozy in the mornings, and then changed to 100 mg which enabled me to get to sleep and not have such a side effect.	At first some drozyness in the morning when taking 200mg, then after lowering the dose to 100 mg., the side effects seemed to subside. I have not noticed any side effects since then except that if I do not have the drug, I will have an extremely hard time getting asleep.	I take 100 mg. each night when I go to bed. I take this drug seven days a week.

649	seasonique	8	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	prevention of pregnancy/lighter periods	Prevented pregnancy & acne	I started taking birth control because it was a month before prom and i was scheduled to have my period then and i would have had it when i was going on a trip to florida, which i was not having. My doctor told me i would probably still get my period around those times, just very light. However i did not get any spotting for three months, i got my period a week ago and it's getting worse. The cramps on a scale of 1 to 10 are at 11, and it went from very light to heavy. I'm not even at the end of the pack yet! I don't recommend seasonique. I was told to take motrin, that hasn't even helped. I've felt like i'm in labor for a week now.	I was actually rushed to the hospital last night because the cramps were so severe. All day i felt a little pain now and then, however towards the end of the day it got unbearable. I was sitting in the air conditioning and i started to feel really hot out of nowhere, had difficulty breathing, nausea, and felt like i was literally about to faint. I'm going to try to get off this pill and try something else as soon as i can!

3184	desyrel	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	I slept well, except that was not my problem. I was forced to miss work due to a very deep sleep.	I took this ONCE, upon the reccomendation of a doctor. I soon became very dizzy and was forced to go to sleep. When it was time to wake up, I couldn't. Finally I did, but with an annoying headache. Later in the day, I got a chest pain. The side effects of this pill are too great.	"""Felt very groggy all day the day after taking first dose. Too strong."""
1345	crestor	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholestrol	The treatment benefits were that my cholestrol levels went from 9 to the 4-5 level.  This was demonstrated by regular blood test results.	The only side effect occured in the first 3 months, where slight aching of the joints and muscles was experienced.  This disappeared after 3 months.	A pill is taken every night before going to bed.
1595	xanax	1	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety attacks	At first I loved this drug. Panic attacks were getting under control and I didn't feel druggy or fuzzy headed.	There were no side effects that I noticed at the time.	Sadly, you can't (or shouldn't) take a drug like Xanax forever. So eventually, after using it for four months, I stopped. OMG. Would someone please explain to me whose brilliant idea it was to create a drug that when you stop taking it, causes the same symptoms that it was designed to alleviate to begin with?!?! I ended up going through even worse panic attacks after stopping the drug than I had to begin with! So in spite of the fact that it worked great to begin with, I would NEVER take this medication again. All in all it turned out to be a terrible experience. There are other far less addictive and nasty drugs available for anxiety.

I can endure a difficult day knowing I can take the pill and go to sleep. I consider it a miracle cure for preventing a full blown depression. Wish I had it available to me years ago...could have changed my life. I would recommend to anyone in for a good experience while getting to sleep!

I like to sing and I found I could sing longer without getting hoarse.	I experienced no side effects, but I was careful not to use this drug continuously over a long period of time, just in case.  Generally I would start using it when symptoms were bad, stay on it for 2 to 3 weeks, then ease off.	2 sprays in each nostril once per day.  It takes about 36 hours to notice a beneficial effect.  Once my allergies were cleared up I could cut the dose in half and stay allergy free.

On a few occasions, mild nausea immediately after taking the drug.	"""I was prescribed Macrobid the same day my UTI symptoms began, by my visit to the clinic it was already very painful.

1946	hyzaar	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high blood pressure	reduced blood pressure and less water retention in legs and ankles	irregular heartbeat, low pulse rate...heart flutter...	When I switched to the generic brand the side effects were moderate to severe, but after returning to the non generic Hyzaar once again, the side effects were less severe and acceptable once again.  I wore a heart monitor and took active blood pressure readings in order to determine if the generic brand enhanced the side effects.  While still not conclusive in my mind, I've elected to pay the extra dollars for the non generic brand.
1141	aromasin	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	breast cancer	Aromasin's treatment benefits are unknown.  I have not had a reoccurance of breast cancer while on the drug, though unsure we can attribute that with the drug treatment itself.  Perhaps there are other positive health-related items coming into play, such as exerciase and eating habits.  Not aware of any side effects or adverse reactions.  Drug is very expensive, however.	As mentioned above, I have not had any side effects from Aromasin other than hot flashes and night sweats.  These may be due to menopause rather than the treatment itself. The hot flashes have been relatively mild and can be controlled, for the most part, by limiting or removing all alcoholic beverages.	"""Aromasin is a walk in the park after using the other aromatase inhibitors."""

3390	coumadin	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	leg blood clot, dvt	The leg clot would not extend nor would other clots form, potentially causing death.	"These were severe and included extreme and continuous nausea, feeling generally shitty (technical term employed by patient), no libido and inability to maintain erection during sex, orgasms that petered out and gave little pleasure, no overall energy for life.
Patient decided to stop medication and try natural/alternative substance to thin the blood.  this resulted in an extension of the clot and increased severity of pain, leading to emergency room visit and subsequent use of different blood thinner, syntron."	Treatment included 2months of heparin injections in abdomen.  Coumadin was given daily after the injections were stopped, at 6mg. The discontinuation of this medication caused an extension of the clot and re-admittance to hospital and another drug for blood thinning was given.   Eventually, 6 months later, a doctor prescribed a compression stocking, which helped dramatically with swelling and pain.  The Syntron blood thinner had no noticeable side-effects.  Except possibly a still reduced libido.

May focus is better on this drug than all the years (about 15) I have been treated for ADD.	None as long as you don't miss any doses.  Missing more than one dose results in vertigo.

I tried different treatments...ritalin (terrible side effects), adderall (didn't work well alone), Adderall with Effexor (Worked great but is hell on your sex life) and then Adderall with Wellbutrin.  I took the Adderall with Welbutrin for 10 years but had to take ambien to sleep. Heart palpatations are another side effect of that combo.  

Menepause hit a couple of years ago and nothing seemed to work well and I developed major anxiety issues.  I started on Estrogen replacement and then asked my Dr what we could try that was closer to the Effexor I tried years ago.  That's when we tried Pristiq.  He seemed amazed at the results.  I do not need a ""drug cocktail"" anymore....I felt like Elvis for years.  I love my life again!"

It was hell when the time came to stop taking it. It's very addictive and I felt nauseous, dizzy and just plain horrible when I first tried to stop taking it. I went back on it and started taking St. John's Wart with it. This helped immensely when it came time to try to quit the drug again. After a few weeks of taking the herb, I slowly started reducing the amount of Paxil I was taking by breaking up the tabs and taking less and less of it each day. I finally got off it and will never, ever take it again. It was a nightmare."

3914	nexium	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acic reflux	The treatment benefits are that it has stopped  the acid from coming up into my esphogus.  I also has benefited from further damage to my esphogus from the acid reflux. I do not have bad breath from the acid and i am no longer horse in my throat when i talk alot. The nexxium has stopped my stomach from producing acid.	After about a couple of months i began to experience severe stomach cramping, bloating, and diareaha.  My body is now completely depended on the drug and my understanding is that the pill is telling my body not to produce acid which in turn works harder to produce more, which makes since when i have tried to go off of it my acid reflux was 20 times worse.  My body has become completely dependent on the drug.	The treatment details were that i did not need to change my diet, but to just take one pill every day and that would take care of my issue with my body producing to much acid.
1089	effexor	6	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	depression reduced - I had taken it at a lower dosage at first - but his had no effect - at all - so psychiatrist had to prescribe a higher dosage than the family doctors are allowed...the effect was amazing - I suddenly felt a 100% better after  a week or so - I had been on the lower dosage for months with no effect.	I felt nauseous. Gradually I became acclimatised the effects- so after the initial boost I felt normal again - like I could engage with life. After a while (6-months) I felt like I was experiencing a distance because of the drugs, instead of feeling engaged in life like I had felt initially, I felt like I was veiled from it.	I was prescribed increasing doses by my family doctor until he had reached the maximum (150) he could prescribe. I tried to commit suicide, I was referred to a psychiatrist who doubled the dose. After seeing the psychiatrist twice over 2 months. I did not have to see her again. And my family doctor could continue to prescribe at this higher dose.
1683	claritin	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	alergy	The medication did provide some lessening of allergy symptoms.  It helped my nose not to water as much.  However, I still had congestion and some days where my allergies were quite uncomfortable.  It seemed the effects lessened as time went on so the medication was less effective than at the beginning. Also my eyes still itched.  My throat also itched.	I suffered from a dry throat, sore throat, and stuffy nose.  My nose seemed to get too dry.  But it still felt congested.  It just didn't run as much.  Also, my bronchial tubes had a hard time dilating at times and I wheezed.  It did not lessen my asthma symptoms even though I didn't have bouts of asthma on a regular basis. I don't think I had any other side effects.	I took the pills every morning and night, about twelve hours apart between doses.  the medication did not keep me awake or make me jittery. The medication also did not make me drowsy like some other allergy medications.  The medication, however, did not always relieve my symptoms.  I ultimately tried another medication to see if I could get better results.  I also had to use an inhaler for wheezing since the medication did not help that symptom.
896	paxil	1	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The drug did help with the temporary depression.	However, the heart palpatations created a condition which was diagnoised as a mitral valve prolapse.  I was told that the condition was congenital.  I explained that I had never had the symptoms/or condition before and was sure that it would have been diagnosed in the 43+ years prior.  After about 12 years, I still, from time to time experience palpatations or flutters around my heart.  About three years ago, I was examined by a heart specialist.  He reevaluated me and said that I DID NOT HAVE mitral valve prolapse.  GO FIGURE.	Depression treated.  The mitral value prolapse was not treated but noted when any medical or dental treatment was performed.
1643	sumatriptan	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name. Imitrex would get rid of the migraine more quickly and more completely.

My Dr prescribed sumatriptan 2 years ago and honestly now I can&#039;t live without it I take one tablet and within 20 mins the migraine is completely gone.

2808	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants."	At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive.	I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience, although I was glad to not need it anymore.
3892	dispermox	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	abcessed tooth	Amoxicillin did little, if any, good for the infection I had with my abcessed tooth. I also had a skin lesion caused by a bacteria, per the doctor, but Amoxicillin did not effect this at all. It stayed the same through the days I took this antibiotic.	I had a severe allergic reaction in the form of red, extremely itchy, welps all over my body, but concentrated on my ribs, chest, and face.	After I had the reaction to amoxicillin, I discontinued use immediately.  I took 2 rounds of Benefryl and the rash cleared up.  The doctor then prescribed a much stronger antibiotic, as my tooth pain was worsening - Cipro.

I had episodes when my whole body would ache, every joint and muscle. It felt like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing it until my eyes would pop out	I started craving carbs. I gained weight but I didn't care because I was feeling REALLY good. As the years went by, I had to keep increasing and was up to 100mg. I had VERY dry mouth, I got to where I couldn't talk because my throat was so dry. I had to have a bottle of water next to me ALL the time, and I chewed gum constantly. I had to take laxatives every 3 days. I was so sick of it, I went to my doctor to see what was wrong with me. She thought it might be the amitriptyline, so she told me to wean off of it and she gave me 30mg of Cymbalta to start. I went down to 50mg and already started to feel my mouth was not so dry. Not sure how the Cymbalta is going to work since I've only taken it 4 days now, but I'm hoping it works.	I started with 10mg.  I noticed a difference after just one week. It worked really GREAT. I was able to sleep with no problems at all. If I woke up for any reason, I'd just fall back to sleep right away.  It was a lifesaver to me. I wish I could still take it.

1096	effexor	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopause symptoms	Effexor was prescribed to alleviate hot flashes, and to help me sleep through the night.	"The most noticeable side effects, especially in the beginning of treatment, were mild dizziness and large pupils, making me sensitive to light, after waking up in the mornings.  That usually only lasts for 30-60 minutes.  
Side effects after taking for approximately 2 months:  Very vivid dreams when failing to take medication regularly.  Also, after approximately 2 months of treatment, the medication does not seem to be helping as much as in the beginning, as I am starting to wake up several times throughout the night again."	Will only take for 6 months as I have heard that Effexor is highly addictive & causes severe withdrawal symptoms.

My triglycerides were already low due to a strict low-carb diet. My blood pressure was already low (104/70) due to verapamil therapy to prevent cluster headaches, and has remained low. I experienced no serum increases in liver enzymes, urea, or sugar.	I experience regular mild flushing, along with mild itching of ears and arms. These effects occur within an hour of dosage, and subside after 20-30 minutes. I do not take aspirin or NSAIDs, nor avoid fatty foods with the medication, as is recommended to reduce the flushing and itching.	I observe a strict Atkins Diet, with regular supplements of a good iron-free multivitamin, calcium citrate-malate, fish oil, glucosamine/chondroitin and coenzyme Q-10. Liberal use of Morton Lite Salt provides good potassium supplementation. I also use a psyllium-husk fiber supplement to consume  7g of soluable fiber daily in 3 doses, which by itself had significantly lowered my LDL and total cholesterol prior to commencing Niaspan ER therapy. I've been exercising on an elliptical ski machine for 30 mins twice per day, burning  1000 calories, and have lost  50 lbs over the last six months.

Also, unlike some of the anti-inflammatory drugs I had taken in the past, I was not drowsy or sluggish during the day and I felt as if I could function normally.	In the beginning I had very slight dizziness that would quickly subside and immediately noticed a significant decrease in appetite. After about 2 months it did not seem to work as well for the pain as it hd been. I also had what felt like strong muscle spasms that made my entire body twitch, but only for a second and only once in a while.  Therefore, I decided that I would discontinue taking the medication.  That is when my problems began.	"""I started taking Ultram 2 weeks ago. The Doctor said I&#039;d notice a difference right away. So far nothing.

Irritable, sleeplessness, rages of angry, fatigue, high blood pressure	My OBGYN switched me from Prozac to Wellbutrin in efforts to help with the sexual side affects.   Well, it did absolulte nothing to help in that area and instead made me more depressed, irritable, had severe rages, crying all the time, no desire to get out of bed, hot flashes and my blood pressure spiked tremendously.   I went back to my PCP and I'm back to Zoloft which I had taken in the past and although I'm still having w/d's from the Wellbutrin, I'm felling 80% better in it's only been 3 days.   I tossed all the remaining pills out.    This drug clearly didn't work for my body.   What a horrible experience to go through.

I previously was taking synthroid however, the company couldnt verify the inactive ingredients. So to avoid gluten, caseine, and some really nasty anxiety symptms I switched to the Tirosint.

2665	prinivil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nocturnal myoclonus (like restless leg syndrome)	Nocturnal myoclonus (similar to restless leg syndrome) causes severe jerking of the legs every 15 seconds for up to 7 hours. Lisinopril allowed both myself and my partner to sleep at night. Somehow, the drug works without the adverse effects the other sleeping pills, neuro transmiter pills and anti-depressants had.	No adverse side effects, but it did keep my blood pressure down.	Though it is a blood pressure medication, I have never had high blood pressure. I have taken Xanax, Ativan, Clonipin, and many other medications to allow me to sleep, but did not stop the nocturnal myoclonus(similar to restless leg syndrome). This meant I did not remain awake to experience the effects, but my partners did get kicked violently, kept awake with my movements and dirupted sleep. Though it is not known by many doctors, the research was down many years ago on this treatment by a VA doctor while in medical school in the 70s. It has been effective for so many years when I went 15 years without getting acceptable relief.
2264	lexapro	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	depression reduced slightly	could no longer have  orgasms	I took lexapro for depression, within 2 weeks it affected my sex drive and within 4 weeks i was having difficulty reaching orgasm, whereas my entire life I never had this problem.

Rhinitis was decreased.  It helped me miss fewer work days, especially when air index quality was poor."	During the time I was taking singulair I did not have suicidal thoughts but I did feel VERY depressed VERY often.  I was VERY thirsty while taking singulair.  The drying effect lead to a few nosebleeds, mostly in the mornings.	I was instructed by my doctor to take one singulair tablet each evening about one hour before bedtime.
1584	xanax	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleeping aid	Was able to get to sleep and stay asleep for a full eight hours.

My mind will stay awake forever and I am unable to sleep a minute.  I am groggy if I do not give myself at least eight hours to sleep after I take it.  I feel like I need to up my dose after some time to get myself to sleep.	I take xanax because I work on a morning show so I must sleep when it is still light outside.  Sleeping pills don't seem to work.. Xanaz seems to do the trick.  It calms my mind so I can get to bed and not think about all the things in my life.
2266	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	major depression	Lexapro has proven to be a very effective antidepressant that is entirely lacking in sexual side-effects.	Lexapro is quite stimulating, which I consider to be a good thing, but I do consider the feeling of being a little too euphoric a side effect of the drug.	"I have suffered from dysthymia (low mood) with major depressive episodes for most of my adult life.  The newer antidepressants, particularly Prozac and Effexor, were lifesavers for me and I expect to be on a daily antidepressant for life.  Antidepressants such as Prozac and Lexapro, however, greatly depressed my sexual desire and ability to reach climax (adversely affecting my relationship with my husband).  These medications also ""pooped out"" (stopped working) after a while, and even when they were working, they would not entirely relieve my low mood.  Ever since my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro several years ago, my mood issues have entirely disappeared with absolutely no adverse sexual side effects."
1927	zithromax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pneumonia	It cleared up my coughing within 2 days.  I could sleep far better at night.	I had mild diarrhea, though I'm not sure if it was due to the drug.	I was told by my doctor to take the medication once a day for about 5 days.  The best results came within 2 days, and seemed to plateau after that.  I requested another prescription so I ended up taking it for about 2 weeks, but I seemed to see little improvement during the 2nd prescription.  It was probably because the bacteria was kept under control, but my body was taking time to heal.
734	claripel-cream	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	melasma	Lightening of dark spots that I experienced on both of my cheeks from melasma. I noticed definite results within weeks; however, with only short periods of accidental sun exposure the dark spots would reappear. Make sure to use sunscreen and hats or avoid sun exposure completely to enjoy continued results.		I washed my face twice a day with gentle cleanser and applied the hydroquinone 4% twice daily. I also used a Retin A cream once a day that caused some irritation and redness, but when used alone, I didn't have this effect from the hydroquinone alone.

The condition was eventually cleared up with Vandazole gel, which did work.		At my annual exam the condition of vaginal bacteria was discovered. The doctor prescribed Metrogel which I took for 5 days in the evening at bedtime. The symptoms resumed within 1 day of completing treatment. A re-visit to the doctor resulted in a prescription for Vandazole gel, which did work.

(I think there was also some mild improvement in skin thickness as well but it certainly did not end cellulite!)

On the other hand, thanks to the increased amount of tetosterone in the full strenght tabs, my interest in sex improved on these. Not so much with the half strength tabs."	I had a salivary estrogen level test done while I was on this medication. Although it completely stopped menopausal symptoms my estrogen levels were still very low. So I'm not particularly concerned about adverse effects of estrogen treatment on these...

3632	retin-a	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult acne	It was fairly successful for the acne.  I found it especially good at spot treatment if I felt a cystic type coming up.	It did dry my skin out and there was peeling in some places, like the sides of my nose.  I had to be very careful about not getting it any where around my lips, because if I did I would quickly get a fever blister on my mouth. I don't know why this happened, but it was bothersome.	I applied it after cleansing skin at night and made sure my skin was completely dry before I put any on and I used a small amount, which was sometimes hard to spread around.

654	seasonique	2	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	heavy periods/cramping	Prevented pregnancy	Breakthrough bleeding, headaches, extreme breast tenderness, breakouts.	I was very skeptical about taking Seasonique, because some friends of mine had taken it in the past and did not have good experiences. However, I had always experienced heavy periods and cramping, even after trying 3 different birth controls so I decided to give it a try. My doctor assured me that Seasonique was safe and I shouldn't have any severe side effects. After only a couple weeks, I started experiencing headaches and extreme breast tenderness. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I started experiencing more side effects. I have been blessed with great skin, only having a few pimples throughout my lifetime. However, after being on Seasonique for about a month, I started to notice my skin was frequently breaking out. I didn't want to stop taking birth control, so I figured I would give it a little bit longer to adjust to my body. About a month and a half into taking Seasonique, I began to breakthrough bleed. I had a full blown period for exactly 3 weeks. I consulted my doctor about a week into the period and she assured me it was totally normal. While on Seasonique, I could definitely feel significant changes in my body that were not normal for me. For these reasons, I would NOT recommend Seasonique to anyone.

Hyperhidrosis of axillae, which I found the most frustrating side effect. Severely reduced libido. Lethargy and general tiredness.	I commenced this treatment due to clinical depression. I started off at a dose of 20mg a day and after initial improvement found that I needed an increase in the dose to 40mg per day. This seems to work more effectively for me. I became pregnant after approximately 10 months on the medication. I continued on with the same dose throughout the entire pregnancy. I did not breast feed. I then became pregnant very quickly again and continued on the medication for this pregnancy as well. Once again I did not breast feed. I have at times reduced my dose to 20mg which has been fine, however if I suffer a depressive episode I increase it to 40mg and generally find this is what I need to stay on.

After the thirty days period the follow up consisted of answering questions about the positive and negative  effects of the drug. After reviewing the answers it was determined that I needed to be on a higher dosage because the symptoms of depression were still an issue.

714	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Eventually Cleared my moderate acne. Had recieved antibiotics etc previosly which reduced it from severe to moderate, but then accutane completely cleared my skin after 5 months	Hair loss! Not so much from my head, but other places such as arms etc. Dry lips were the worst, tried many different products but eventually carmex solved that. Dry skin slightly, not too much of a probelem. Depression was bad, would have no motivation to do anything and hated everything around me. After stopping the drug this discontinued and i deem it acceptable to have, for the results of clear skin.	I can't remember ever having the initial flare ups/breakouts other people have reported. I was warned about this by my dermatologist but i can't say i remember it. I noticed no difference in the first few months and became very frustrated at this. It was only towards the end of the fourth month that it started to become noticablly clearer with only a few spots. By the end of the fifth month i was clear, and remained clear for a year. However the oilyness of my skin has returned and i would now class my skin as having mild acne, but it only affects the areas around my nose, unlike before where i had it all over my cheeks. If you notice any spots return, contact your derm to be put on a second course of accutane as i am, otherwise it can return more serverly and undo all the progress you have previously made.
1557	methotrexate	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	Methotrexate kept the RA from progressing rapidly. Pain, swelling and stiffness were noticeably less when taking medication. It did not stop RA progress completely. In addition, arthritis nodules did develop.	Had to get monthly blood tests to check liver and kidney function. Once, after about 3-4 years of usage I had an abnormal blood test and was told to stop taking methotrexate for a month, then re-take blood test. Upon normal test, went back to taking methotrexate as usual. Did not notice any effects during time of abnormal blood test.	Injected myself in the thigh once a week.

Although the pain was not diminished completely, I noticed that when I had severe pain, the meds did absolutely no good.  Perhaps if I'd taken more than the recommended dosage, it would have been effective, but I did not want to do that.  It also had a negative effect on my brain.  I could not think clearly, I felt like I was in a fog.  I also spent alot of time sleeping which was another side effect I did not like.	Took this med following surgery for pain control.

This drug is poison and should not be given to children.  My daughter was prescribed this for mild asthma.  Doctors don't know or don't care about the dangerous, life-threatening side effects of this drug.  This is Merck's biggest money maker.  There are much more effective, less dangerous treatments for asthma.  Spread the word.  Get active.

"Started using Cymbalta 60mg to primarily for chronic tension headaches and neck/back pain and the resulting depression from chronic pain.  Worked wonderfully for about three months then slowly lost effectiveness.  Tried increasing to 90mg with little response.  Ended up switching antidepressants and finding different means to treat the pain.
It was a good drug when it worked, but unfortunately it didn't last very long.  It also acts on serotonin like an SSRI and started my dependency on SSRIs."

It has kept my skin SO clear, and it's almost too easy. Just mark your calendar for the third sunday after insertion, and that's when it comes out!	I don't know if many people have had this, or maybe it's just a coincidence that it started at the same time, but i have developed irritable bowel syndrome since using it. Also, I can't ever seem to get it in far enough, it's always slipping down. It is felt TOO much during sex, so i have to remove it everytime. It's painful for us both if left in. I sometimes feel mentally unstable and can't remember if I felt this before.	Put it in on sunday, three sundays from then you take it out. You'll start your period on wednesday, then put a new one in that following sunday. TOO EASY!
815	ambien	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	The drug does get the patient to sleep very soon after taking the drug.	The side effects are not worth it.  While it gets you to sleep, it makes you incredibly groggy the next day.  I had problems concentrating.  Also, I started sleepwalking with no memory of my actions.  This can be very dangerous.  Also, after taking it for a few days, it would become difficult to stop taking it.  I would rather not get as much sleep rather than take this medication.  I only take it a few times a year now mostly to reset my clock if I've traveled, but would never take it on a regular basis.	The treatment does not require very much other than taking the prescribed drug as needed.  However, if you take it a few nights in a row, it it difficult to stop.  But you should stop because it makes you very groggy and gives you headaches during the day.  It is good for a sleepness night when back from traveling so that you can get back on a regular sleep schedule.  It should not be taken on a regular basis.

The terbinafine 250mg tablets were taken, 1 per day, for a little over 2 months. The first symptoms of the rash were noticed as slight, itchy redness on the skin around the chest and stomach area. These symptoms were noticed on 5/21, about 7 weeks into the treatment, but the condition not diagnosed as an allergic reaction until 6/10. By that time it had spread to 70% of the body, on the torso, back, and legs. The diagnosing physician suspected the terbinafine, and the patient immediately stopped taking the drug. Assessment of the original condition (toenail fungus) was that the terbinafine had already successfully resolved it.

209	elidel	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothryoid-related dry skin	Elidel reduced my dry skin by about 80-85%. It increased exfoliation, which is very slowed down in hypothyroid-related dry skin, got rid of many of the blocked pores due to poor exfoliation, and stopped the vast majority of the flaking, burning, and redness I had suffered from before I used it.	The first week I used Elidel I got some flu-like symptoms, as warned on the package insert. It stands to reason that Elidel would make one very sun-sensitive, as it shuts down the skin's immune system; I didn't have a problem with this, as I always wore sunscreen, but it made me nervous. As I understand it, Elidel isn't formulated to help the skin help itself; instead it just shuts off the skin's erroneous response. For some skin conditions, this is sufficient, but it wasn't for me.	After washing my face with gentle cleanser, I applied a small amount of Elidel to my entire face, before following up with a moisturizer (or two), then sunscreen.

2886	avita	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	skin aging/sun damage	Within 4 days my skin became visibly smoother, pore size was markedly reduced very quickly and after just a few weeks there was increased firmness and generally younger looking skin. Crows feet and forehead lines also diminshed. Skin strength was greatly improved and I did not need to where make-up to hide imperfections as much, my skin looked more polished.		A dermatologist prescribed Retinova and told me that the longer I used it, the better the results would be. This proved to be correct. He told me to mix a pea sized portion with my usual moisturiser but to only use it once a day, I used it at night. He also stipulated that it was very important to use an effective sun block as Retinova increased sensitivity to sunlight. A number of people commented on the improvement in my skin. After about 12 months a large, brown patch of sun damage on my temple flaked off and didn't come back. I was very disappointed when I went to get my usual 3 month prescription and was told that Retinova was no longer available. I have subsequently used Retin-A but without the same visible results. This wasn't prescribed by the original dermaltologist, he didn't believe Retin-A was suitable for what I wanted to achieve for my skin. Over the counter products containing retinol do help smoothness a little, but nothing compared to the dramatic changes I experienced when I used Retinova. What amazed me the most was how quickly some of the changes occurred, within only a matter of days.
3570	differin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The treatment easy and convenient and effective for skin turnover to prevent acne.	Differin was drying and particularly the 3% solution.	You are to apply nightly to acne spots but I found it worked better as a preventive measure all over face once your face is used to the drying. Differin worsens any open wounds but is a great preventive measure
2985	strattera	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	Greater focus, stronger commitment, lessened stress, improved self-confidence, goal setting, less depressed, better organization and memory (as in remembering events), clearer in thought and expression thereof.	Lower regard for self-value, naturally depressive concepts seem less far-fetched, appear less happy.	"With or without this medication I am a philosopher. So I will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.

Background:
I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

On the drug:
I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

Understand that this drug does not control me, I control this drug. I suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. As you examine how it affects you, you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug."

I took this drug for 1 year and 4 months. The anxiety and depression affected me almost immediately although I was completely clueless as to the cause. I cycled through every single anti-depressant and ADHD medication trying to solve this problem. It wasn't until I stopped the medication that I realized it was the Propecia. THESE SIDE EFFECTS HAVE NOT SUBSIDED AT ALL SEVEN MONTHS LATER! I would not wish this on my worst enemy. This drug has literally destroyed my life. I know that no one wants to lose their hair and look unattractive, but just imagine how attractive you will be if you are one of the unfortunate few of us that gets gynecomastia, penile fibrosis, and inability to ejaculate (I CANNOT EVEN MASTRUBATE TO ORGASM after taking this drug). If you value your life then I strongly suggest you find some other way!"	"""Don&#039;t take this drug.  I used it for a few months and it killed my libido.  I did get some noticeable hair re-growth during that time, so at least that worked.  It became very hard to get an erection and I became completely disinterested in sex.

I&#039;ve read accounts that some people never regained their libido, and suffered lasting erectile dysfunction.

This is not natural.  Your libido is part of who you are, and so is hair loss.  Be a man and accept the loss of your hair as part of who you were meant to be."""

My mind stops trying to jump from one subject to another every second; memory retention/recall improves DRAMATICALLY. I also find it FAR easier to fall asleep at night, seem to sleep better, and seem to be far more emotionally stable. I also do not ""crash"" from it later in the day like my former (stimulant) meds. Also does not appear to be physically addictive."	Severe grogginess, often accompanied by lightheadedness, upset stomach/nausea - ALL aggravated by sleep loss or lack of food, become slightly less severe after I'd been on it again for a couple of weeks. Severe grogginess was slightly alleviated by caffeine (espresso) or some rest (nap) or both. Best solution appears to be to take the meds with or after food, and to attempt to get a decent amount of sleep. Also notice a certain level of dependence (NOT actual addiction though) - mostly due to return of symptoms in medication's absence. I may also have dry mouth, but I'm not sure if that's the meds or if I'm not drinking enough water.	"Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me), then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication. Seems to retain efficacy, COMPLETELY eliminate stomach problems and GREATLY reduce grogginess -though that also seems to be partly dependent on how much sleep I get (minimum of 6 hours, preferably 8 or 9). Now that I discovered this trick, I am feeling MUCH better and no longer considering abandoning the medication! I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus, remember, and feel more aware of surroundings. Would cry now if I had to go back to not using it - I almost can't function without medication, and the non-stimulant allows me to sleep SO much better and I do not ""crash"" from it!"

1364	permapen	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	viral bronchitis	Absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  Through research I learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  No idea why my doctor precribed Penicillin.  Would rather he had been on the up and up about it instead of precribing a worthless treatment.	No side effects at all, just took an antibiotic I did not need and do not see any health benefit in that at all	Doctor diagnosed me with Viral Bronchitis after and xray.  He then prescribed Penicillin to treat it.  Worthless treatment, since Penicillin is totally ineffective to fight a virus.
1278	provigil	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fatigue not being able to get up in am	When I started first taking it it was great. I would get up in the am no brain fog, and could work the whole day not being tired. By night time though I was exhausted. After a month or so I still get up early but by afternoon I am so tired I usually try to take a nap or just keep going and eventually it will get better. I have not tried taking another in the afternoon. I have tried to up the dose in the am with no difference.	I am not sure if this is from the provigil or not but I have started having major breathing issues. I have had this a long time ago but started taking celexa for it and it worked. Now I am taking klonopin for it sometimes it works sometimes not. I wonder if it is being caused from the provigil.	I just take one 200mg every morning when I get up. If I do not take it I thought is why I would be so sleepy during the day. But now I get sleepy anyway. But the waking up early is great were as I could not get up before.
2977	strattera	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	Treatment benefits include improved attention to task, improvement in work quality and quantity. Impulsivity was greatly reduced, resulting in a calmer more productive day. Social relationships with co-workers and others were markedly improved. Social relationships with extended family members were also improved. As a result there was a marked improvement in self esteem and confidence levels both at work and at home.	There wer few side effects.  I experienced intermittent episodes of dry mouth that interferes when during public speaking, speaking at meetings and in social situations.  This can be resolved with small candies, however, that resulted in tooth decay.  I am currently trying out a gel and mouthwash given to me by my dentist, however, I am not happy about putting these chemicals in my mouth.	"""I&#039;ve been on Strattera since 3rd grade. And I don&#039;t understand why so many people are against it. I have only experienced good results with this drug. My grades have increased, I am able to focus in class, and I can excel and prosper. My doctor has told me that eventually I will be weaned off of Strattera because my brain should be able to adapt. All I can say is. I never experienced any horrible side effects, if any. I can&#039;t say I remember any side effects. And I know that it is not addictive since I am able to stop taking the drug during the summer time.

I initially started taking Wellbutrin because it was tauted as having little to no sexual side effects. I really was highly disappointed in the overall experience of this drug. I immediately switched back to Effexor.	After a couple of days of taking the drug, I started experiencing severe flash anger. The smallest nuisance would set me off. I remember actually throwing something across my dining room. It was awful. At that point I decided to no longer take the drug.	I am not certain what I should describe here. The treatment details were that I was prescribed a medication after having asked for it due to its advertised benefits and I never have been so disappointed in a medicine until this one. I am not certain if other people have had similar experiences or not, but it wasn't pleasant.
203	fosamax-plus-d	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	osteoporosis	Between 1998 and 2006, when I was going through menopause, my bone density went from normal to borderline osteoporosis, as shown by the results of two bone density tests given on those dates. After I received my bone density results in 2006, my physician put me on Fosamax, which I have taken regularly for the past two years.  When I took a bone density test recently in 2008, my bone mineral density had increased by almost 6% over a two-year period. I remain in the range of osteopenia, but am midway now between normal and osteoporosis in my T-scores.	I have experienced no adverse side effects at all while taking this medication.	I take a pill in the morning when I get up, once a week, on the same day each week.  I take it with an 8 ounce glass of water and do not lay down, eat, or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. I also take calcium/d vitamin supplements daily, eat plenty of dairy products, walk at least 3 times a week, and avoid alcohol and soft drinks.  I was already following these dietary habits when my previous bone density tests were done.  Because of that, I credit fosamax with the improvement  that has taken place.

Granted, my dose was low, but I had a hard time concentrating and summoning up the energy to do basic things like paying bills, etc. Vyvanse is no wonder drug, but I live pretty much like everyone else now, which is great. My mother is stunned. She says this is the first time she's ever been able to ask me where things are in my apartment and have me know (and be right). I take a medication holiday from Vyvanse most weekends and actual work holidays when I don't need to be able to concentrate.	A little bit of sleeplessness at first. I take Vyvanse in the morning at around 5:30 to fix this. I just set my alarm, take the pill with a glass of water, and go back to sleep for an hour. I then wake up around 7 without any problems.	1 pill, 30 mg, Vyvanse, as needed. I never take more than the prescribed amount (not trying to get addicted, here).

I was given Cipro.  Three days into the Cipro, there was no change.  I also was waking up at odd times of the night, which is odd because the Lyrica puts me into a deep sleep.

I still have hot flashes during those hours, however I seem to be in a deeper state of sleep and during those hours I usually don't fully awake during the hot flash, as I used to do.  I used to be almost fully awake every time I experienced a hot flash (every 1 to 1.5 hours).  Now I get a few hours of fairly good sleep at the beginning of my sleep cycle.	There are no adverse side effects so far.  Some nights I don't sleep as deeply (as described above) during the first few hours of sleep.  I'm not sure what makes the difference from one night to the next-perhaps the amount of sleep I got in the few nights previous.	"""This does help a little but it doesn&#039;t take it all away."""

Since starting to take wellbutrin my sex drive returned, my ambition and motivation returned.  On my last medication I was going to sleep at 8 p.m and sleeping until morning then requiring a nap in the afternoon and now I sleep 7-8 hrs a night and have enough energy to get through most of my days.  I had a 5 lb weight loss in the beginning that I have maintained.  Over all I feel I am managing my depression better than I have at any time in the past.	Side effects in the beginning were a bit of anxiety that eventually past but recently I have been having trouble concentrating, my memory has been poor.  Generally I feel like my iq has dropped  I have also been very teary and find myself crying a fair amount over small incidences almost like I was pregnant.  None of this may have anything to do with the medication but I am concerned.	I went up to 450mg once a day but cut back to 300mg a day about 6-8 mnths ago and didn't find I was less able to cope with my depression. I do find that I feel depressed more often but I recognize the signs of the depression and use coping stragies to deal with what is happening.

Terrible taste in mouth, 4 and a half hours of constant dry-heaving, painful and sudden headaches, body aches.	"""I have been on it for 10 days and don&#039;t feel any better. It gives me a metallic taste and heartburn. It also caused me to have vivid dreams and problems sleeping."""
3483	diazepam	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleep	Most often the diazepam got me to sleep fairly quickly but did not last the whole night through.  The liquid capsules were then superceded by tablets which usually took about twice as long to kick in.  ie, 40 mins instead of 20. The benefit was there if I was unable to sleep otherwise but a benzo sleep is not natural and feels different to real sleep.	Twitching nerves for several days afterward.  Difficulty sleeping.	"""Since beginning my dose of 10 mg of Diazepam 2x daily, my sleep is nowhere near restful. I have wild dreams, they feel very realistic and usually start well, but end in panic right before i wake up. This of course contributes to the giant versace bags under my eyes because I feel as if instead of sleeping, I just went through something crazy! At night, I take 10 mg 30 minutes before bed. Before that, iIfeel anxious, tense, and upset. I usually have to cancel plans with friends or loved ones because I can not get myself to put the effort in. Nights feel SO long and I used to love sleep, but now I almost want to avoid sleeping. overall, I&#039;m not seeing how Diazepam is better than Klonopin, if anything, it&#039;s worse."""
893	paxil	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	panic attack and anxiety	The Paxil relieved my anxiety and mild panic attacks at first. After time my doctor needed to increase the dose to get the same effect.	The side affects were that I needed an abnormal amount of sleep.  The higher the dose the more time I slept.  Also my blood pressure went up and I gained a lot of wieght.	"I started with half a 10mg pill a day. It was the increased to a full 10mg a day.  I then went to a 10mg and a half pill a day. Then went to 20mg a day.
I then went off Paxil entirely. My blood pressure went down and I lost a good anount of wieght but not all that I had gained. I did have some very high axiety at first but then it subsided."
223	wellbutrin-xl	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anti-depressant	The biggest benefit was when I quit smoking, because I had been taking it for a while...it proved to assist with the cravings...it's probably why I was able to quit in the first place.	Made me kind of grumpy and a little weight gain.	Started taking anti-depressant when my Mother passed away.  Started a low-dose and increased over a period of 3 months.  I believe Wellbuterin was very beneficial and did not have major side effects.  I stopped taking them 2 months ago and haven't had any withdrawal symptoms.
3107	ortho-tri-cyclen	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	With proper administration I never feel too many side effects associated with hormonal imbalances.  I also use it as my primary source of birth control have never become pregnant.  Even during months that I failed to take it at the same time every day, I did not become pregnant.  The pill is super tiny and easy to swallow.	You have to be careful to take the appropriate dose (one pill per day at the same time). You MUST keep it on you at all times so that you are able to do so.  Missing a dose would often induce my period which would linger for weeks.  I also noticed a dramatic difference in the quality of my hair.  Over the last few years of taking the medication I have lost over 75 percent of the super thick head of hair I once had.	The treatment is relatively simple and safe.  It is also supposed to decrease your chance of cervical cancer.  Take one pill each day and there is a 99 percent chance of not getting pregnant.  However, you can increase your risk of blood clotting if you are a smoker.  You highly advised to be smoke free throughout treatment.  Once treatment stops you must seek another form of birth control.
2479	enbrel	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ankylosing spondylitis	My worst symptom was in my feet. It was painful to walk, and therefore I walked slowly even when I used shoes with good support (Birkenstocks), especially going down stairs. There was some pain or discomfort in my lower back. These were my symptoms when I was on methotrexate alone. When I started Enbrel, I felt the effects within hours. Within the same day I could walk decently with much less pain. Within the next few days and weeks, I'm practically back to normal. In my second month, I think I started to feel a tapering off of its effects, which doctors warned me about and I read about: I felt a faint shadow of the foot pains I used to experience but I can still move normally.	None that I can tell	I inject myself twice a week in the stomach area, which is a feat because until this happened, I was scared to death of getting injections.
491	meridia	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	obesity	Initially weightloss of 4 stone and an increase in energy and confidence. After stopping the drug there was a gradual weight gain of 10lbs until weight settled and has been maintained for 3 years. Health has improved and an increase in fitness and regular exercise has been maintained.Benefits have outwayed the side effects as all other attempts over the years to lose weight had failed, and there is a family history of heart disease.	Side effects at the time included worsened insomnia and irregular menstruation ( already suffered from before starting drug, but worse while taking it) and mood swings. Insomnia and irregular menstruation have continued, mood swings have improved but both continued conditions may have worsened naturally anyway due to naturally occurring early peri-menopause as there is a family history of this.	Drug dosage reccomendations were not followed, and only taken in the morning as this lessened the side effects.

I feel alitte sleepy (yawns) but it obviously did zip aliviate  onset insomnia.
1554	methotrexate	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	To reduce high blood pressure. To reduce pain and inflammation of Rheumatoid Arthritis	Feeling Tired, lethargic. Dry skin ,  dry mouth, dry eyss. Nausea.  When I actually take the methotrxate  I feel as if I have a temperature and cannot do much for the first day. 48 hours hours after taking methotrexate I take a 5mg dose of Folic acid to reduce the most harmful side effects of taking methotrexate.	I take one 15mg dose of methotrexate once a week along with sulphasalazine and naproxen to reduce activity of my very active rheumatoid arthritis. The pain and inflammation is still there but has reduced slightly. I also take Bendroflumethazide to reduce high blood pressure taken on a daily basis.  I have researched on the internet and found I need to increase my daily intake of water/fluids. This has never been mentioned in the contraindications or by my GP. I understand the reason for increasing fluid intake is because the medication I take is cytoxic and I need to keep my kidneys and liver flushed as much as possible, which is why patients who take methotrexate and sulphasalazine have monthly blood tests.
343	neurontin	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	My migraines did decrease significantly while on this medication. There was a clear inverse correlation between my Neurontin dosage and my migraine frequency and severity (more neurontin, fewer migraines)	"I was a zombie. Some aspects of this subsided over the first year, however others did not. My vocabulary suffered horribly and never really recovered. I went from being a very well spoken person to someone struggling to grasp some words over three letters. Coworkers even mentioned to me that they noticed this effect. My memory suffered horribly as well. I would have to cut back on my dosage during exam times (I was in school as well as working at the time). There seemed to be absolutely no way for me to memorized the volume of work I needed to while on this drug.

The sleepiness I experienced was awful. This diminished somewhat but never entirely over the four years I took it. A couple of times I had to pull over while driving; staying awake seemed to be out of my control entirely. The sleepiness was overwhelming at times. I once fell asleep while speaking one on one with a coworker. While on Neurontin I also had an annoying tendency to forget what I was saying mid-sentence--very embarrassing in a professional setting. Since abandoning Neurontin and switching to Lamictal I no longer have this problem."	Used as a migraine prophylactic, my Dr. simply increased my dosage over time from what I believe was 300mg. per day up to 2400 over approximately two months. I was to take the medicine throughout the day but I sometimes opted to take a bulk of the total dose at night before bed--the fatigue it produced in me did assist my sleep. Unfortunately no matter when I took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! This decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. I will say however, it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. But I opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving, possibly killing others or myself. Unfortunately my physician did not take this side effect seriously the many times I told her; after three years of this she continued to insist this side effect would subside. It did lessen but NEVER subsided to a safe level. She's no longer my physician and I now take Lamictal.
1899	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe peridontal disease	I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish.	None.	A dentist in my dental HMO prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because I implored him to do so.
2360	propecia	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	male pattern baldness	Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.	I was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull. This pressure would subside and I would go about my day. I'm told headaches are not one of the usual side-effects, so it may be an unrelated fluke. However, I've never had such an experience before, and it only manifested within about forty-eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy-two hours thereafter. The sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided, however, but I would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout, especially if driving or in a public place with bright lights and a lot of noise around.	Overall, whether I am having some sort of placebo-effect reaction or not, my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller. I presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day, which I filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately. The formulation I was prescribed was 1 milligram, although I believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams. My case was mild to begin with, so it may be difficult to judge results. However, other than the mild side-effects I described above, which subsided within three days, I must say overall that my experience has been a positive one.
130	valtrex	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	herpes	The product was used to clear up a primary outbreak of herpes.  It was said to speed up the process of healing.

It is to be taken along with the metformin. It has helped control my blood sugar very well.	It can sometimes cause nausea. At the start of treatment it was bad but now it only happens if I miss a dose then the next one will cause nausea.  The first couple of months I saw a very slight drop in weight but I am not sure if the Byetta caused this.	"""Byetta has helped me lose 32 lbs in 63 days. I have kept my sugar levels in the 100 range since starting this medicine. I was 253 pounds at 5 foot 9. Diabetes was not something I ever thought I would get but my glucose numbers were in the 300 range and fasting they were 250! The doctor put me on byetta and metphormin. I will be honest, at first, I ate the same bad foods and was throwing up every time! Now, I keep my sugar grams to 22 grams a day and 110 grams of carbs. Once I controlled the sugar and carbs, the nausea stopped! You just need to re-train your brain! My eyes wanted to get lots of food but I couldn&#039;t eat it after byetta! Just know your body and if it&#039;s too much, tell your doctor."""

I would hope that the effects are long-lasting, but I have only used it for 2 months now.	I noticed dryness, photosensitivity, irritation of mucus membranes.  I had to use moisturizer more than usual and reapply it during the day due to dryness.  I used a broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunblock with it (Avene SPF 50	I applied nightly to dry clean skin.

I did have a nagging cough which neither I nor my doctor connected to Cozaar.   She thought the cough might be due to reflux and I started taking generic Omeprazole (Prilosec) and the cough went away.

427	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine headaches	I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting.  This has been extremely beneficial to me.  I have gotten my life back.  I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days.  I would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable, which is not me.  I am a very responsible person.	I have never had any negative side effects from Imitrex.	I take half of a tablet at the first sign that a migraine is starting.  Usually within 45-60 minutes the beginning symptoms of my migraine are gone.  Once in awhile, at this point (60 minutes after I have taken half of a tablet) the symptoms are not noticeable different, so I will take another half of a tablet.

1792	citalopram	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I did notice right away a marked improvement in my insomnia and no longer require the clonazepam.  I too felt a weight lifted off my shoulders and my disposition improved.  I felt much better than I had in years.  Little aches and pains in my lower back and hips which I've been treating throught the chiropractor, became more tolerable.  My husband was pleased and thinks I'm much easier to live with.  I didn't realize how grouchy and difficult I had become.	I have trouble waking and getting up in the morning.  My lips are very dry and nothing seems to help.  My mouth is also dry first thing in the morning, but improves as the day progresses.  I yawn excessively.  I don't have as much energy, I have to force myself to take an evening walk.	Dr initially told me he thought my insomnia was depression.  I was desparate.  The sleep deprivation was making it hard to function at work and home.  I agreed to take 20 mg of citalopram.  My insomnia didn't completely subside, so I still was taking clonazepam .5 mg about every other night.  After a month, the dr upped the prescription to 40 mg.  I slowly made the transition from 20 to 30 then 40 mg.

1950	lyrica	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia	There was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  I believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  The side effects were so severe I was afraid to drive the car.  My memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and I still felt pain. My thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence I sounded as if I was on drugs.  The side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  I could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  This medication was meant for Diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  I feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  As all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  I would not recommend anyone take it.	Irrational thinking, disrupted thought process, Slow reactions while operating a vehicle	Prescribe to me by my DO as the newest drug for Fibromyalgia she did not know how the drug worked but wanted to me to try it to see if it reduced my muscle pain.

I got sicker than anyone who has been through it can imagine. I went into a detox after Mothers Day and was started on Suboxone. I take 16mg a day. I guess my dose is higher than most people due to the amount of pills I used to take (anywhere from 20-25 30mg Oxycodoness a day). On Suboxone I&#039;m a better mother and person.

I initially began using Retin A Micro all over my face and neck (avoiding eye area) every other night.  My skin is fair and a little sensitive and it has tolerated it very well.  Every other day I do get a slight peeling of my skin around my mouth, my chin and my nose.  This peeling can easily be removed by sloughing off the peeling skin.

But even so after your body becomes adjusted to Zoloft, that side effects eventually just leaves.	Well I went to see a doctor and talked about my situation, and for the first three visit, she just talked to me, then after the 3rd visit, she decided it would be a good idea to put me on Zoloft.

2909	tramadol	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	fibromyalgia pain	In order to get any effects, I had to take 4-5 times the prescribed dosage.  The medication is simply VERY WEAK.  This drug did prove to me that managing pain on a daily basis, rather than responding to pain, significantly improved my quality of life and activity level.	"I did not experience any side effects on a normal or high dose.  A VERY HIGH dose (only taken accidentally, because I forgot I had taken my usual dose earlier) on an empty stomach, will produce an unpleasant ""high"" feeling mentally, including spaciness and shakiness.  Therefore you can't just keep taking more and more of the drug."	Bottom line, this drug just isn't very effective.  It's more effective, and SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER, than the NSAIDS that docs are still prescribing for fibromylagia.  But I am looking for better daily pain management.

Within 2 months I noticed my eyes felt strained all the time so I continually have to refocus.  I get tremors in my hands every couple days and can't stop them from shaking.  The worst - and the reason I'm choosing to change medications is the excessive sweating.

Not more than a small pea size of cream was directed however this was quickly absorbed into the skin and could not be applied over the remainging area of the face. Caution was applied in ensuring that the treatment gel was not applied to mucosal areas. Nevertheless it did radiate to areas such as the eyes and lips causing severe dryness and chafing.

1731	topamax	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post traumatic stress syndrom	Decreased appetite/impulse or emotional eating, stress reduction, anti depressant	vision affects - blurry vision	I believe that the topamax has helped me to lose 90 pounds of excess weight - I still need to lose at least another 50 pounds.    It helped stabalize my moods and I didn't feel so sad and depressed after going through an abusive marriage/separation then divorce.  My psychiatrist prescribed Topamax during that time.   Then I was able to discontinue treatment for about 2 years.   I then had an accident, where I was then diagnosed with PTSD and fibromyalgia as a result of the accident and have since been on Topamax for two years steady since the accident.   I have lost the weight in the last 16 months.
3719	lamictal	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	mood swings	It took a while since the dose increases so slowly, but I started to realize that I wasn't reacting so severly to my daily emotional changes. If I was upset about something, I wasn't experiencing the sever mood swings I normally would. My frustration and anger no longer controlled me. A general sense of being able to handle my negative emotions without falling apart. My family noticed a big difference.	in the beginning I had symptoms of vertigo which occured when turning my head or standing quickly. The dizziness felt worse each time the medication dose was increased and eventually stopped or was significantly less pronounced. The feelings lasted about 2-6 weeks. Some weight gain.	I was seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for over a year and had tried 4-5 medications for depression, some worked temporarily, some not at all. Both therapists thought my symptoms indicated Bipolar II and I should try a different approach. I stared on a very low dose, as indicated, so the benefits took a while to notice. When I reached 150 mg, thought it was too much so dropped back down to 100mg and have been on this dose for about 18 months. i have a med check 3-4 times a year.
765	flonase	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	allergies	Effective inrelieving runny or clogged nose due to allergies, stops itchy,swelling and watering eyes.	Only lasted for 8 hours max, I was given specific instructions not to use more than once a day, so I still had to rely on over-the-counter pills after the 8 hours were up.  Caused asthma in cold, dry weather and a very, very scratchy throat, as in physically having to scratch at my throat to relieve it.  Worsened a pre-existing eczema condition.	Used 2 pumps per nostril, once a day to relieve everyday allergies.

I really don't understand the readings but initially they were like 140/90. now they read 120/70.	none that i know. well ask about. or re-read. Even if i feel a little spacey, it's not so much that i can't function. It actually may be the combination of the bupropion.	"""I started taking Norvasc after trying many other meds. including Topamax which had too many bad side effects for me. So far since starting about a month ago; I have only had 1 headache and that was at the very beginning. No side effects. I was having headaches which was affected by weather pressure; about 1 a week. So nice not to have them and to feel good on this medication."""
3595	differin	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles around eyes	to be honest, I am uncertain yet. I believe it will take months to see results	severe dry skin. I was instructed to use less frequently until the dryness was not an issue	Apply nightly to face. Wash off in am. Do not use more than every other night due to potential dry flaky skin.

1398	nardil	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression (atypical)	A dramatic decrease in the level of depression and a great increase in a feeling of well-being and hope for the future.  There were also considerable cognitive benefits: thought processes speeded up, memory became stronger and intellectual creativity increased.  Also the constant fatigue that accompanied the depression decreased and this made possible an exercise program that increased energy and enjoyment of strenuous activities.  In addition my general and social anxiety decreased dramatically.	The most troublesome side effect was faintness upon rising quickly from a seated (or horizontal) position.  On one occasion I lost consciousness and fell.  However, this side effect went away after three months or so.  There was also some decrease in sexual desire, but this side effect also lessened over time.  A side effect that seems to be permanent is lower blood pressure, but this is actually a benefit for most people.  I've been told that some people take MAOI's solely to decrease their blood pressure.	"""Nardil works very well for my bipolar depression. I had hypersomnia when I was depressed and the drugs I tried (Lamictal, Zoloft, Celexa&hellip;) didn&rsquo;t help at all. I&rsquo;m glad my psychiatrist made me try this medication. 
At first, I took 45 mg, but after a while, it made me maniac. I had to lower the dosage to 30 mg and, surprisingly, it&rsquo;s seems to be working (even though it&rsquo;s not considered as a therapeutic dose).
The diet is very easy to follow, as long as you can take bottled beer. The only downside is the sugar cravings, which are difficult to resist."""

My skin has been extremely red the entire time I've taken this medication. It is so drying that even my ears and lips are persistently dry.

4123	chantix	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	nicotine addiction	I had smoked for 20 years and despite repeated quit attempts using Zyban (bupropion), nicotine patches (and nicotine gum, lozenges etc), I had never managed to stay quit for long. Chantix enabled me to quit my 10 cigar a day habit with minimal craving and after the first week of treatment I really didn't feel the urge to smoke anymore.	"I was nauseated after taking each tablet. The nausea started about 20 minutes after taking the tablet and lasted for about 30 minutes. I was never physically sick and the nausea was bearable.
I had greatly reduced libido and difficulty getting and sustaining an erection. My orgasm was delayed, diminished and not satisfying. Sexual function returned to normal when I finished the Chantix course.
I had difficulty sleeping and felt fatigued throughout the treatment.
All things considered, the side effects were worth it for the benefits. As smoking causes premature death a few side effects are a reasonable trade off in order to quit."	Standard treatment regime. 0.5mg on day 1, then 0.5mg BD up till day 8, then 1mg BD till 3 months. Gave up smoking on day 10 though smoking had lost most of its appeal by day 7.

The doctor originally thought that I simply had depression so she prescribed an anit-depressant.  After about a year things still were not right.  So she did a thyroid panel.

I tried to (without my doctors advice or knowledge) get off the medicine cold turkey when I lost my insurance. Doing that made me extremely emotional. I would start crying for no reason at all and felt crazy! I went back to the doctor and talked about my situation. She set up a program to slowly take me off the medicine.

At first, it took my body some time to adjust.  It revved up my system.	My doctor didn't know much about Fibromyalgia, so the only thing he prescribed was the Tramadol.

My skin has not wrinkled as fast as my friends of the same age.	At first I had dry skin. I used it every other day rather than every day until my skin adjusted.  Other than the initial dry, peeling skin, I had no side affects.	I applied the Retin-A to my face every night.  At my dermatologists suggestion, I did not wash my face before applying the cream.  As mentioned above, when I first started treatment, I used the product every other day until my skin adjusted to the Retin-A micro

Ease of use over creams, etc.	none	"1 pill every morning at least one hour before eating.  Topical medications were a hassle to use consistently, were seldom ""cosmetically elegant"", and did very little to keep symptoms from escalating.  Dermatologist prescribed Oracea when it became obvious the the topicals were never going to control the pustules.  Oracea cleared it up in a couple of weeks and gave consistent results throughout treatment - Rosacea was practically forgotten about - with no side effects.  Several months after discontinuing use, pustles have returned but are nothing like before treatment and are manageable with OTC topicals.  Expensive but Oracea does offer discounts worth looking into."

Sleep-eating, and night-time snacking.  Definitely stimulates appetite shortly (w/in 30 mins) after taking.  I do not have this side-effect with other sleep preparations.	"Take Ambien in various dosages (up and down) for primary long-standing (over 25 years) insomnia.  Have tried various drugs over the years. Better results compared with temazepam, lunesta, melatonin, lorazepam, trazadone, but stimulates appetite and ingestion of (yes, I started counting!) 300-400 extra calories at bedtime and shortly thereafter.  About 10# weight gain.  Often have had best results when dosage is high enough to induce sleep rapidly, ""skipping"" the chance to get hungry."

As it had to be taken on an empty stomach I took the tablet about 1 hour before breakfast, and one hour before dinner. Instructions were to avoid dairy products 6 hours before and 2 hours after taking this medication, but I found this to be too restrictive, and so I did not adhere to this recommendation.

Personal benefits: i controlled my weight better, skin looked more radiant and menstruation pains were alot less than when i was not on the medication.  As i grew older though i have been warned of being on contraception after 32 and I am also a smoker, this apparently increases the risk of cancer.  However, after terminating the pill I had a huge amount of hair loss over 8 months which I was never warned about	side effects - when leaving the pill - i started losing my hair - alot of it	daily dosage, usually taken at night time, managed my weight, and helped with my skin as well as a contraceptive

The sinus headache, nausea, and anxiety were immediate, but flu like symptoms and lesions didn't appear until start of 3rd week. I then stopped taking Oracea. It made me feel like my body was falling apart, the back pain, nausea, and flu like symptoms weren't worth having an acne-free face."	"""I used to have terrible acne on my skin, and so I went to my dermatologist and he prescribed this. I used it for about half a year, and my acne was starting to clear up. Although, I recommend wearing lots of sunscreen during the summer, because you will get facial sunburns. But oddly enough, while using Oracea, I started to experience moderate heart palpitations and panic attacks and anxiety, and so I stopped using Oracea immediately. I am not sure that I recommend this to everyone."""
2602	ortho-tri-cyclen-lo	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	pregnancy prevention	Prevented pregnancy, acne was lighter, predictable periods	Extreme nausea for first 3 months, migraines during 4th month, contact lense use was disrupted, some weight gain (about 3-5 pounds) after the 3rd month, moodiness, lethargic, increased appetite, breast tenderness and enlargement	The side effects were very severe. Sometimes I thought I was pregnant because the side effects are similar to those of pregnant women. However, during the placebo pills, my period always came. I spoke with my pharmacist and she said if I have such side effects with this lower dosage I might get more severe effects with the higher dose.  I am still taking this hoping to ride out the side effects as the severity seems to lessen over time.
2066	metformin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	diabetes	My blood sugar is under control. I went from an A1c of over 8.0 to an A1c of 5.3 over the course of treatment. This medication has had minimal side effects and I developed a tolerance to the side effects in a short period of time- about 30 days. This medication is easy to take and doesn't dissolve on your tongue thus avoiding a bitter pill taste. In its generic form this medication is quite affordable.	I experienced minimal side effects. Initially while titrated the appropriate dosage and timing of the medication, I experienced some episodes of hypoglycemia. However, once my dosage was adjusted I no longer had episdoes of hypoglycemia. I did experience some gastric upset with this medication in the first thirty days. I had issues of cramping, gas and upset stomach after taking the medication. However after thirty days my body had gotten accustom to the medication and I no longer have any gastric side effects.	My diabetes treatment is three fold. I take medication ( glucophage, gliperide, & actos) follow a diabetes friendly diet and exercise regularly. My medications are glucophage 1000mg in the morning and 1500mg at night; actos 45 mg in the morning and gliperide 20 mg in the morning. My diet is based on a 1800 calorie ADA diet with meals including no more than 60 grams of carbohydrate and snacks with no more than 15-30 grams of carbohydrate. My exericse is a minimum of 20 minutes of walking 3-4 days a week.

I took Fosamax from 2003 to 2007, when my gynocologist switched me to Boniva.  From what I've heard lately, Merck knew of this problem but would not publish information regarding what could happen to other bones.	April 29, 2010 I broke my femur (rt leg) mid-thigh due to a pre-fracture very possibly caused by taking Fosamax.  Clearly from the x-rays my body was trying to heal the fracture.  After walking I would notice an aching at the site about 3-4 months before it broke.  I did not fall hard nor far--just about a foot and landed on my right foot.  This is obviously a huge consequence for taking this drug.	"""Started taking June 2013, once a week.  4 weeks into taking started having headaches but didn&#039;t connect the dots.  Then started having severe sharp pain in back and upper right behind rib cage. Pain so severe, went to ER, where they didn&#039;t know the cause (had my gallbladder removed 18 yrs ago).  Finally spoke to my primary and the connection was made."""
2185	clonazepam	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	agoraphobia, panic disorder	"Taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life."	The Rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  However after taking it for a few years and feeling I no longer needed it, I found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  I have cut the dosage down considerably, from 5 mg at night to one, then I became nervous again and started taking 2 again.  I have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  I would always go back on it.  I never felt I needed MORE...I just coudn't stop taking even a small amount.	"I was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  As Rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  I was prescribed it for this reason.  I am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

I feel that it did the job, but had I known I would be on it for the rest of my life I'm not sure I would have started taking it.  But maybe if I was desperate like I was then I would.  I was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  She did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after I stopped breast feeding her.  No one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  Back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  Only for epileptics for life.  She is 13 now and perfectly normal.  However I do feel guilty about having put her through that."

I had to go to an eye doctor & get eye drops.  My dermatologist started me back on the doxycycline & said I had to take it ""forever""."	If if take the 100 mg, I get an upset stomach, so I called the doctor & asked him to replace the medication with two 50mg tablets each day, which I've been taking for a week & it works much better.	I need to take the medication twice a day, but one hour before eating or two hours after, which has turned out to be a really big nuisance, since I like to eat six small meals a day.

My nausea was not controlled at all, in fact I felt more nauseaus after taking the medication.	I had severe restlessness, developed an intense feeling of anxiety, had an extreme desire to sit down, then lay down and went on to develop a dystonic reaction.   I developed an intense feeling of doom, my stomach had feelings of cramps, knotting and pain.  My neck felt tense and the ambulance was called and I was taken to the emergency dept of local hospital.	"""I started this medication for Gastroparesis after 11 months of not being able to keep anything down. I noticed it helping after first two doses. I was so excited until the awful side effects started. Drowsiness to the point I couldn&#039;t function, severe stomach and back pain and bowel issues.

At the end of the 12-week treatment, half of the toenail grew back to normal. The doctor advised stopping the treatment at the point.

Overall, skin became smoother and lighter after cleansing.	Sever redness and scaling occurred especially around the chin and the cheek, which could not be covered with makeup.  Mild itching sensation was a little disturbing to focus at work.	Applied at night, after cleansing the face, more than thirty minutes before going to bed.  Used ~1 cm of the cream for entire face and neck, followed with 4% Hydroquinone solution.  When swelling occurred, application was omitted until it disappears, which usually took place in 24 hours.

Further, medication was taken during pregnancy with no apparent ill effects to the fetus, and with the benefit of carrying to term with none of the adverse effects associated with hypothyroidism and pregnancy.

"""Have been using it for about 2 years, no problems light period, no weight gain but I didn&#039;t realize my lack of sex drive until I got off of it.

4125	chantix	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	Loss of the desire to smoke and eventually the cessation of smoking altogether.	Fatigue and gas.	Literature says that desire to smoke should cease after 2 weeks.  It took about 3 1/2 for me.  Chantix effectively helped me quit smoking without horrible withdrawals and side effects.  It has been 1 year and 4 months now.  I am completely free of cigarettes now.  Chantix was the only thing that helped.
695	accutane	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	The acne cleared up for the most part for about 6 months to a year afterwards.  Then symptoms returned and there was no difference in the severity of the condition prior to treatment.	Chapped lips, dry skin, sensitivity to light.

3020	cipro	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	epidimytis	Got rid of my raging epidimytis and prostatitis. The pain started to subside within 2-3 days. Within the first week almost all symptoms were gone. Minor symptoms persisted until the 11-12 day. By the 14th day all symptoms were gone. BUT - the side effects were awful.	"Let it be known that I have been treated once before with ciprofloxacin, where I experienced no side effects. This time was a little different...

- muscle pains in thighs, chest, and traps. 
- tightness of chest 
- joint pains - specifically on the outsides of my knees. some pain in wrists, elbows, and upper back.
- semi severe pain in lymph nodes of neck w/ little to no swelling.
- complete anxiety that i had lympoma; both swollen lymph nodes and anxiety are side effects of Cipro
- general anxiety
- made me poo a lot. (kinda funny in retrospect)
- low sex drive
- pain in lower rib cage, a little higher than the kidneys. could not identify weather muscular or otherwise.
- pain in diaphragm
- pain in neck
- pain in upper jaw (only experienced this once for about an hour)
- pain in jaw would often radiate to pain in temples
- ringing in ears/dulled hearing (this would last for about 5 minutes at a time)
- very slight muscle twitching (only sometimes)
- i would get ""pins and needles"" very easily
- i was colder than normal for the entire two weeks
- i was very irritable - but i can't decide if my short temper was a side effect of the drug, or if it was caused by the drag of having so many side effects.

Other than the frequent bowel movements, I had no stomach or nausea problems. My bowel movements were very normal, and stomach aches were never an issue. 

All of the side effects became persistently worse, starting off as very minor side effects and progressing to a moderate stage. Some of the side effects (particularly the lymph node pain) didn't start until the second week."	14 days of this crazy drug solved my infection, but the side effects were killer. Ask your doctor about alternatives before starting ciprofloxacin.

For a while was on higher dose of topomax at 100 mg but seem to experience some memory issues but did not have any further issue with this once the dose was reduced.	This was an off label use of topomax which was under the supervision of my doctor who saw me regularly for diabetes.  It was important to lose weight to improve the diabetic condition.  It was supportive in helping me maintain the discipline of the diet program that the doctor also recommended so that with the combined approach I succeeded in losing 52 pounds in a slow, healthy manner.
72	flexeril	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	tension in jaw and bruxism (grinding of teeth)	I woke up with a more relaxed jaw. I have bruxism which is the medical term for the grinding of teeth or the clenching of jaws. So if I have alot of tension in my jaw before I go to bed I will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. Taking Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) before I go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to Bruxism.	I have only had one side effect due to mixing Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) with Maxalt which lead to being fatigue and drowsiness.	"It has been only 1 week of taking Cyclobenzaprine so I may experience different side effects the more I take it. So far this medication has worked for me. I did notice one very positive benefit from taking this medication this 1 week. I started this medication around the same time I start to get PMS symptoms ""Mainly very moody and argumentative"" and I'm amazed how Cyclobenzaprine effected my PMS symptoms. I have absolutely been the most pleasant person to be around.  It feels great to be myself and not angry at everything."

My doctor gave me a prescription for Tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course.	I think I remember not being able to taste very well.  But that could've been a side effect of the flu. And after taking Tamiflu the first time, I kinda remember being able to breathe more deeply than normal.  That effect wore off after a few hours.  Seemed to get used to the medication & didn't experience anything else.	"""The flu hit me out of no where but I knew what it was so I went straight to my doctor within 24 hours after experiencing symptoms. Since I caught it early, my doctor prescribed me Tamiflu. I started it right away and the first dose made me so nauseous, dizzy, and I experienced vertigo. I was considering stopping it but I had heard great reviews about it; I also had taken the first dose on an empty stomach. For the next couple of doses I made sure to eat something before taking Tamiflu. From doing this, I had no nausea or dizziness. It could be a coincidence but I think it really made a difference. It definitely shortened the duration of my flu."""

Feeling like i drank 2 bottles of vodka! the nausea is unbelievably as well as the head heavyness, lightheadedness, foggy. The doctor told me to finish the medication, but i just cant. it is almost impossible for  me to hold my head up! I will not take this medicine again. it is the 2nd time it was prescribed to me, id rather be sicker for a few more days than deal with the aftermath. and thats saying something!	"""I had to stop taking this (amoxicillin liquid) after it made my throat swell up and affected my breathing.  I strongly believe that it was the yellow colouring in the medication which caused this rather than the drug itself as I have had allergic reactions to Tartrazine on several occasions and I now read labels thoroughly.  I wish medications could be prescribed that do not have added colourings as a large number of people, like me, are allergic to several azo dyes."""
2931	quibron-t	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	the medication kept my asthma under control or so i thought.    as an aside, i still have a few left and every so often if i am out of my migraine medication, i will take a theodur and it seems to alleviate the headache.  it was inexpensive.	while I was on it, i never really experienced any side effects. except one time when i accidently took too much and became dizzy and nauseaus. when i went off it i suffered two weeks of migraines due to withdrawal.	i took 300 mg. twice a day and also used an inhaler regularly.   i assumed it was as good as it gets.  my new asthma specialist determined i had suffered some loss of lung function as the asthma had not been controlled as well as it could have been.  i had to have regular blood work to determine the levels were right.
2925	tramadol	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	post-surgical pain	Eliminated the pain without the mental side effects of drugs like Vicodin.	Seemed to be a very mild mood elevator, but that could just have been due to having my mood improved from not being in pain. For the first couple days of taking it I suffered moderate insomnia/waking up during the night. This went away over the course of treatment.	After surgery, I was offered Vicodin or Percocet but do not like either because they cause me to be too foggy mentally. I initially tried just Advil but that didn't work on the pain. The Dr. prescribed generic Ultram (Tramadol). It took quite awhile for the first one to take effect (more than an hour) but it provided long-lasting pain relief. I was a bit leery of it because I read online that it can be addictive however, after 3 weeks I cut the dose to 1x a day instead of 2x and then after 4 weeks stopped entirely with no ill effects after that.

2498	remeron	3	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	Hardly any except I felt so physically tired that I couldn't even feel depressed.	I was so exhausted that I could hardly get out of bed and get to work. At work, I just wanted to put my head down and go to sleep. As soon as I got home around 6pm, I had to go to bed. It was ridiculous.	"""Remeron at low doses worked beautifully for my insomnia.  At high doses (I was on 90mg. at one point for depression), it was useless for me.  As my doctor once put it, &quot;For depression, Remeron is not a heavy lifter.&quot;  But for insomnia, it was a God send.  The only problem came when I tried to wean myself off of it.  I had little trouble until I got down to a quarter pill (0.375mg).  I got terrible rebound insomnia and eventually had to go back on.  It also made me gain 14 pounds."""

3797	tussionex	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mycoplasma bronchitis	Suppression of cough	Drowsiness, dizziness, dream-like state, very mild haluccinations, weakness in arms	I was battling a severe, deep, incessant cough, and was diagnosed with mycoplasma bronchitis, probably contracted from my spouse who had walking pneumonia. I couldn�t go for more than 2 minutes without coughing, and couldn�t sleep through the night.  After suffering for well over a week, I finally was prescribed Tussionex (my spouse was too), and it was the most amazing relief � it suppressed the cough, and I could finally sleep. Due to the side effects, I haven�t taken it for any common colds or flus, but it was worthwhile for my severe cough.
2874	avita	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	It reduced my acne considerably. It provided a very smooth feeling to my skin that I did not experience with anything prior to using this medicine. It also gave me a rosier complexion with a glow.	The only side effects i experienced were a slight stinging feeling. this subsided after the first two weeks. If the stinging sensation does not subside it is preferable to use it every other night instead of every night.	I used this every night after cleansing my face. I waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before the application. It was also recommended by my doctor to wear sunscreen the next morning since this medication causes skin sun sensitivity.
2731	elavil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	I had fewer headaches and the headaches which I did have were less severe and easier to relieve with medication. I have fewer days off from work and can enjoy life with family and friends without worrying about headaches.	I experience an increase in headache severity after taking the medication as well as nausea and light sensitivity. But I only have to take 1 pill, tolerate the increase in symptoms for about 1/2 hour and my headache is gone. And, I don't have the headache hangover I used to have with other medications.	I take a daily medication at bedtime (amitriptyline) which reduces the frequency of my headaches (significantly!) and then I take Axert when I do get a migraine headache.

I have noticed no side effects. I have never needed to increase my dosage over the course of five years, and when I skip a dose, my insomnia is exactly what it was before taking trazodone, no worse.	"""Since around age 4 years old I&#039;ve had a problem with sleeping. After having my kids my sleep what sleep I was getting went away. By time I hit 30 I truly thought I was going to die from exhaustion, then grand babies came my thought than was &quot;ok now what I do&quot;, my HCP blew me off. So I returned to my old HCP and with my PTSD and OSTD he put me on traz. And first night on traz 50mg I slept for 12 HOURS OMG it was so amazing only problem I see is its like a alarm clock....I wake up at 4:00am no sweats...no dry mouth...etc. I never knew sleeping felt so good and I&#039;m almost 50 yrs old.

475	remicade	5	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	colitis	Stopped bleeding and relieved some abdominal cramps.	After only 3 treatments I have developed common side effects, as in dizzines which keeps me from being too active. I am always tired even though I am finally sleeping most of the night, I have developed the bumps on the forhead that everyone talks about, and I have the need to constantly unrinate. I have been reading reviews online now for a week and am getting concerned because most comments show that people find the side effects worse than the condition and I have just started. I believe that I am also suffering from depression, but because I am a single parent I try to keep myself busy with family issues which allows me to put aside the bad feelings temporarily.	Have done 3 infusions, starting with 2 weeks after first and then 4 weeks. Now I am awaiting my 4th which will be 8 weeks. The staff have been great, from the nurse who does the procedure to the councillor at Bio-Advance, but the one draw back is that I have been telling both the nurse and the councillor about my side effects and they acted so surprised. So why did I find out by going online myself that these side effects are common?
2724	elavil	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia - early awakening	restful sleep	carbohydrate cravings leading to overeating and overweight.  I also tended to always needto increase the dose over the years. When I started using this drug, I was given a 50mg dose hs.  I developed a tolerance and the dose needed to be increased until it reached 300mg.	I was refered to a pharmacology specialist to see how I could be weaned off such a large dose in order to help control my weight because of the triggering of the carbohydrate cravings for which elavil is well known for.  I have partiall been switched to topamax( 150mg hs with 225mg elavil hs) and I almost immediately lost 15lbs)

There was an increase  of hair growth of the front hair line, but it was not substantial. My hair also grew at a faster rate than normal.	the side effects of taking finasteride 2.5mg per day for six month period were feeling dehydrated, having dry mouth. Especially in the morning. I also experienced a lower libido than normal. I also experienced a lower level of energy throught the day. the side effects were not extreme and did go away after discontinuing the treatment.	The treatment details were the oral intake of finasteride. I obtained it in the 5mg form known as proscar. I would cut the tablet in half to get a 2.5mg dosage. I took 2.5mg of finasteride every day at night before i went to sleep. If i missed a dosage i waited for the next day to take the next dosage. Taking the whole 5mg dosage per day in my opinion would be to high a dosage. The side effects would increase.

During times of great stress, would take up to 300mg/day. Stayed on 200mg/day for a year, then lessened to 100mg/day for another year to reduce side-effects, particularly memory and mood flattening effects. Eventually stopped treatment in order to pursue non-drug therapies, but would go back on the treatment if stress or life events triggered strong mood episodes.

Gas was bad at first along with consptipation.  Gas and constipation disappeared when I lowered the dosage from 2 mg per day to 1 mg per day.  Neck/shoulder tension/pain still exists, but worth it to stay smoke free.	Began Chantix Starter pack, then quit on Day 7 or 8 of Chantix.  Been smoke free for 30 days with no withdrawal pains whatsoever.  I plan on staying on 1. mg of Chantix for another 60 days then tapering Chantix until drug free.  This is a miracle drug.

It also proved useful as an antihistamine whenever I had similar symptoms after the normal allergy season (March through April).	I did not have any notable side effects during the course of taking the drug.	Take one tablet daily during allergy season.
2298	lexapro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression and anxiety	Seemed to take effect after the first dose. I noticed a considerable reduction in my anxiety and feelings of sadness. I was able to overlook the little things where as before they would really get to me. I was having all kinds of muscle twitches so I went to see my doctor who examined me and decided it was due to my stress levels. I am a mother and a wife and I was reluctant to take anything to help with my situation but am now glad I did.. I am only a week into it so I guess time will tell. But so far I am happy with the results.	Slight headache/stress in neck after the first dose although could be due to my resistant feelings of taking this to begin with. A bit of feeling shaky right after taking doses but controlable.	I am to meet up with my doctor again after 2 weeks to see how it is affecting me. I am taking 10mg once a day in the afternoon after lunch. I have made an appointment with a therapist to also help me. I don't see this as a forever fix but for now it is doing the trick..... Meanwhile it allows me to focus and feel like I want to better myself so in the end I am hoping that this is just a bandaid until I heal myself or find a way to deal with things as needed.
2554	ziana	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne / blackheads / oily skin	Ziana minimized the large sore pimples.  I continued to have a few during my menstrual cycle. However, I continued to experience blocked pores / blackheads and very oily skin.  The product did not appear to help this.	Ocassionally I would experience very mild flakey skin.  However, given my oily skin it was only noticeable right after I washed my face.

My recovery from anorexia was not easy, so I had a few months of moderate bulimia.

193	adderall	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	possible add	"The adderall allows me to focus and study better.  I definitely function better while taking it.  I am prescribed to take it ""as needed"" which means that I don't take it everyday.  I tend to take it most school days (med school) and take more of it during testing times.  I am prescribed to take it up to 3 times a day, but I rarely have taken that much."	If I take a 5 mg pill later than 3 pm or so it is difficult to fall asleep.  I sometimes get jittery or feel like my heart is racing.  Sometimes I have strange muscle twitches that I can't control.  Some days it makes me lose my appetite completely, which doesn't sound bad but I'm already a little underweight.	Since I control when I take the meds (what time, how much- up to 3 per day) I think I have over-done it on occasion, even though it was never above what I'm perscribed.  Some days I will take 3 pills so I can truly concentrate, and then can't sleep. . . may have to take a sleeping pill. . . wake up feeling awful and groggy. . . and have to do the whole viscious cycle all over again.  So, even though I'm doing what I'm perscribed to do, it can be too much for me.  I can understand why there is abuse potential with this drug, as you start feeling dependent on it.  Even with all that, the drug has helped me out more than I can ever explain.
1576	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic attacks	within 10 minutes the drug began to calm down the situation and I was able to function normally again. My racing heart rate was decreased, the feeling of panic subsided and the numbness in my arms and legs went away. I was able to eat again, and go about my daily routine.	The only real side effect was that depending on the severity of the attack and the amount I took, as sometimes I cut the pill in half, or if the case was extremely severe, I could take up to 1 mg. was that I got very sleepy. In a lower dose that was not the case but in the higher dosage it did occur.	The treatment details were to take only as needed and it could be taken up to 3X per day, but usually one pill did the trick. I didn't have a set protocol for taking the medication because the attacks were so random, they might not occur for months at a time, or they could happen two days in a row. So, I was told to take it only as needed. I still have a number of pills left from my RX of 30 last year.

2065	warfarin	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	heart condition	"Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.
I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment."	"The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me?"	"""Severe muscle pains especially in the neck and shoulder area"""
1590	xanax	6	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	When I am in highly stressful situations, I start to cry.  I took xanax at times when I knew this would happen and it worked perfectly.  I did not cry at all, my eyes didn't even water.  This has never happened with any other medication.	While the drug did give the desired effect, I was groggy and tired.  The worst side effect would be that I had short-term memory loss during when I took it.  I would see notes that I took at the time and not remember writing them and had trouble remembering the details of conversations I had at the time.	Dr. suggested I take a lower dose to decrease the side effects but when I did that, I still cried during the stressful situations.

Anyway after two days of taking Baclofen 10mg twice per day I feel like a new man.

2242	accolate	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	capsuar contracture of breast implant	The benefits were not good, and this drug was very expensive and was not effective at all for the problem I was experiencing.  At the time when I was experiencing complications from the implants, I truly believed that my Doctor did not prescribed the drug in time.  The literature I read on this drug claims that it is more likely to work if used early in the treatment of Capsular Contracture.	I tolerated the medication very well.  I didn't experience any illness or side effects from Accolate.  I felt a strong mental negativity towards the drug when it was prescribed based on the literature I read and my Doctor's statement about being treated early.  I think I tried the treatment knowing in my mind that it was not going to work.	I was required to take Accolate for three months to promote softening of my Breast Implants. The 20mg tablets were to be taken twice daily along with continued daily massage of my breasts.  My Doctor said that the treatment had more chances of being effective if used early in detecting the Capsular Contracture (My treatment was started 5 months after the breast implant surgery).  If the treatment didn't work, he advised, I would need surgery.

Diminished acne resulted within the first month and more significantly for the following months. After 1 year, patient reduced to taking pill once per day.	Side effects were mild, but a similar derivative had significant side effects so this patient recommends trying another sulfur-based drug if this once poses problems. Side effects with trimethoprim included very mild sun sensitivity-simply use a sunscreen; occasional yeast infections once or twice per year; upset stomach if taken without food.

I am now severely addicted to this medication with no way to get off it. Any attempt to stop taking the medication leads to severe physical and emotional pain.	I agree that this medication has some positive effects but the negative side-effect FAR OUTWEIGH the good.

Within 2 days the reflux symptoms were controlled.  She only had problems if she ate an excessive amount late in the evening and needed to sleep on a wedge to prevent sudden reflux while asleep.  She has noticed that if she does not take the Nexium, the symptoms reappear within 2-3 days.	THe patient had been treated with Prilosec for reflux.  While being evaluated for chronic insomnia, a 24 hour study was done to constantly measure the pH of her stomach/esophagus junction.  The study found, while using Prilosec, her stomach acid was 10 times what was considered normal.  She began using Nexium and repeated the 24 hour acid study about 6 months later.

Severe heartburn occurred 5-7 times a week before treatment, and was brought down to 2-3 times a week during treatment.	Chronic constipation, dry mouth and mild dizziness. The side effects, aside from the constipation were usually mild and went away after treatment was discontinued.	40mg a day of Prilosec were prescribed to me after I complained to my doctor of chronic heartburn symptoms. I began taking it that day, and once every morning there after. Heartburn symptoms began to subside after 2-3 days of taking it. Mild side effects after about a week. The most noticeable and bothersome side effect (constipation) began after about 9 days of treatment. After putting up with it for a week I went to my doctor. He prescribed a mild laxative and suggested I stay on the Prilosec for at least 2 months to get the drugs full benefits. I did, but the constipation was still there (laxatives helped some). The doctor switched me to Nexium, which worked just as well and without the constipation.
721	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	cleared up acne with first treatment.	Very very dry skin. Lips were chaped and nose was dry. Eyes were a little dry as well.	I was 15/16 years when I was on accutane. It's hard enough being in high school but having acne on top. I tried every acne treatment and my doc finally put me on accutane. It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!
2329	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Before taking Lexapro, I had constant anxiety.  I wasn't haveing panic attacks on a regular basis, but I was having them one in awhile.  My anxiety presented itself more in constant worrying, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep, and feeling tired but restless all the time.  I was moody and impatient, and obsessed about little, insignificant things all of the time.  Once I started taking Lexapro, that all changed.  It did all go away completely, but i can manage the slight symptoms I experience now.  I am much happier, much more stable, but more successful in my life.  I know others on it (my husband), and they have experienced the same kind of success.	I have never experienced any side effects.  I take it every morning and it's like taking an asprin...you don't notice any type of change.  If I miss my dose a few days in a row, I notice my behavior changes and I get moody and worry-some, but it takes a few days to experience that.	I have taken 10 mg a day, every day, for the last 3 years.  It took a few weeks for the medicine to take effect (about 2) and the chance was gradual, but one day i woke up and noticed that I felt normal.  It has been wonderful for me and I am very thankful I have access to it.
2568	klonopin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Treatment provided the patient with the ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the entire night	The patient noticed a grogginess in the morning that subsided after approx 10 minutes.	"""I have anxiety disorder and ocd which has made me depressed over the years. I have tried various SSRI&#039;s and some antipsychotics, none of which seemed to help with my overwhelming anxiety obsessional thoughts and compulsions. They also gave me unwanted side effects. I am very scared when it comes to taking medication, and will only take a pill if i really need too. The only thing that seems to help in easing my mind is Klonopin! I have no noticeable side effects from taking it . It makes me feel like my old self, helps me to be focused and relaxed, and gives me the confidence to do more things. I would definitely recommend this medication for other anxiety sufferers out there."""
2237	allegra	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, itchy ears, itchy throat, sneezing, nasal drip, congestion and borderline asthma; however, during high allergy season, the regular dosage was insufficient, the beneficial effects lasting only about 12 hours, instead of the intended 24.  Then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above.	Increasing the dosage to twice daily during high allergy season resulted in horrible side effects such as severe headache, nervousness, heart palpitations, dizziness, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the loss of appetite. I had to stop taking it altogether for four to five days, before I felt comfortable in taking it again.  Now I take only one/day regardless of the extent of allergies.	"""It works great! My nose is like 98% of the time clear, just some sniffles every now and then when it&#039;s windy. I&#039;d recommend it to anyone who has a stronger stomach (as it caused me to go to the toilet more often as a side effect), then me. Hardly any fiber in my diet, I&#039;m trying to change that."""
2260	lexapro	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	Initially, Lexapro helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. I noticed that situations that would normally aggravate me (i.e. stress of work, children, college assignments,etc.) I was able to handle better.	"Although some stress was alleviated, I noticed that I spent more time in a ""vegetative"" state. I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though. I read somewhere that an earlier version of Lexapro (or similar type of pill) caused heart problems thus was pulled off the shelves. Who knows the story behind that. It has taken me two long horrific years to get back on track. I am now approaching my issues naturally and am doing better (not to say this completely stopped my life - but it did seriously change it)."	I took approximately 5mg a day. I visited my doctor on monthly basis, and was in contact with her via phone during first several weeks (my doc was old school... she really cares about her patients). I was placed on this treatment as I was a single mother of two very young children, employed full time, and attending college full time. The stress wasoccasionally overwhelming and my usual source of alleviating stress (exercise) was no longer helping.
286	panixine-disperdose	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	skin infection	My skin became infected from scratching too much and too hard when I had an allergic reaction to a topical skin product.  A day after I started taking the medication, I noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.  I was prescribed zyrtec in conjunction with the antibiotic but it causes severe drowsiness.  My doctor had me discontinue the zyrtec and see how I did with the cephalexin alone.  I continued to heal faster than I think I would have without the medication.	I had no side effects	Take 1 capsule three times per day for 14 days.
426	imitrex	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	If I have a classical migraine, I cannot function without taking an Imitrex. Imitrex takes the edge off the pain, takes away the feeling of nausea and I am able to work on the computer, which I otherwise could not do with a migraine. The pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. The drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. Today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking Imitrex.	I usually feel really tired and depressed the next day after haven taken Imitrex. I feel the drug depresses all systems. It takes off the edge of the pain, but still leaves a dull feeling in the head.	I take an imitrex within an hour of onset of a migraine headache. However, I do not take more than one Imitrex per day. Also, I usually do not take it two days in a row, if I don't have to, as the drug makes me feel very tired and depressed the next day.

Decrease in skin lustre and elasticity"	Lost interest in sex rapidly, if I was ever aroused (very rare) I couldn't achieve an orgasm, every part of my body seemed to dry out and subsequently age a bit and in the case of my eyes this drying and ageing process was pretty severe. Doctors were baffled as to why I'd ended up with such dry eyes at such a young age, said they weren't sure what caused it but said it normally happens to menopausal or elderly women (I was 20-21 at the time). Now looking back I realise that the dry eyes match with a lot of the other symptoms I was experiencing at the time, many of which are normally symptoms of the menopause/ageing. Considering these symptoms have now either completely disappeared or improved since stopping the use of hormonal birth control methods (I now use the copper IUD), I believe they may well have been linked Yasmin. Yasmin is one scary pill- I came off it worried that I was prematurely going through the menopause and that I would never be able to enjoy painless, bloodless, pleasurable sex again.

Side effects were enjoyable, so I was especially careful to take it only as needed to reduce risk of dependency.

It is cosmetically appropriate and easy to put make-up over.	I've had mild dryness/redness was was easily counteracted with a good moisturizer.	"""I love Duac! It completely helped clear up my acne last year alone! This was my most favourite acne treating product along side Quinoderm 10% which I can no longer get anywhere!! I rate Duac a 7/8 out of 10 as it was great but wasn&#039;t as good as Quinoderm 10%. I still use Duac every night before I go to bed. I do still have some spots /scars but comparing my face this year to how bad it was last year wow big change and I believe Duac has improved my skin so much. Sometimes makes my skin dry,red and sore but that&#039;s only if I apply too much. It&#039;s keeping my skin under control and I&#039;m happy with that. I don&#039;t usually store Duac in the fridge.

Methadone really worked for me, and after a while, I tapered at a slow rate.	None.	Ten Miligrams daily.  Of course, at first you have to deal wiht the clinic, but take-home doses are easy to earn as long as you're doing what you're supposed to be doing.
1200	prozac	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Before I began taking this, I had experienced a long time, chronic depression. After about one month of taking this I began feeling much better. Although things still are not perfect, and I have very blue periods, it has at least made life tolerable.	Reduced sex drive.  Had quite a normal sexual appetite before using this, and it has decreased dramatically.	Began taking 20 mg daily then increased it to 40 after 3 months.

2862	soma	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraines/upper back pain	None really.  At the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep.	It wasn't long until I became physically and psychologically dependant on the drug and the treatment became much worse than the problem for which it was prescribed.  Soma is listed as a muscle relaxant which is quite misleading. Because it has been cleverly marketed, it is readily prescribed (or was) and very accessible. I think many pain management physicians prescribe soma for their patients without much thought as to the risks.  The major adverse affects is the rapid tolerance developement and short term memory loss.  There were a number of times that I'd forgotten if /or how much I had taken, which on one occasion precipitated an emergency room visit. It should be classified as a schedule 2 drug at least because of the potential for abuse and overdose. I think this drug should be taken off of the market.	"""Did not work for me.

If I did not receive enough sleep it would be very hard to wake up and I would feel as if I had not slept at all making it very hard to stay alert.  I would say at least 6-7 hours of sleep is needed.	Take one daily at bedtime for rest due to anxiety.  This prescription was issued for six months and I am currently still taking it.  It does not appear to be addictive as there are nights when I can sleep without it and do not crave it.

2876	avita	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Produced considerable clarity in my skin and cleared up deep acne without scarring.	I had extremely dry skin, some temporary redness and peeling of my facial skin.  At times it was extensive enough to require a heavy moisturizer.	I took an oral dose of acutane along with the facial creme, Micro-A tretinoin to dry up the oil my face was producing.  It was a highly effective treatment plan that resulted in long term acne relief.
1672	claritin	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic sinus congestion	The drug cleared my sinuses but took some time to become effective after use. The effect only lasted about half a day. I would take this off and on for about 3 months.	I felt like I was hopped up the whole time. My skin would feel crawly and I would be generally jittery and not able to focus. I lost concentration and felt high the whole time. It also made me feel really dehydrated.	The medication was for my use during a sinus infection at first to help relieve congestion. When the sinus infection subsided I still had congestion fairly often so was prescribed to take is as needed. I would usually take one in the morning when it was worst. I stopped after a few months due to side effects and made diet changes to relieve it.
1026	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult add	With this medication versus other drugs to treat ADD, I do not experience a coming down off of something effect. It is highly effective without the severe side effects of comparable medications to treat the same condition. Also, it does not destroy my appetite and I feel healthier with particular medication. I don�t experience dry mouth (but I have always been a huge water drinker!), nervousness, irritability, insomnia, or that racing heart feeling.	Appetite is reduced, but not to an un-healthy degree. Smaller portions at both meal time and snack time are all that you can manage during the day. However, in my experience I eat normal dinner portions. In fact, I feel that with this medication I am eating ample, healthy portions for my gender, body-type and build.  It should be noted that with this and other medications like it you are often so focused it is easy to forget to eat, but it will catch up with you later in the day. You will want the portions you should have had, but no longer have the hours left to spread them out. I set a timer to remind me it�s time to stop and have lunch.	I take this medication once each morning and it lasts throughout the day and into the early evening. With this medication you must see your provider every six months to evaluate weight changes and effectiveness. During the 2 checks that I have had my weight has been consistent. Luckily, dosage has not been modified; we started out with the correct dosage. Although, from what I understand that is rare, dosages often have to be modified to find what works best for each individual.

It definitely worked for cutting my appetite as long as I took it twice a day.  If I took it once a day at about 8 am I would feel hungry at about 5pm.  If I took it twice a day 8 am 10am I could make it to bedtime without being hungry.	Side effects were random for me most of the times.  I would definitely NOT feel the energy that it was supposed to give me.  Sometimes when I would take it it would have the opposite affect on me and actually make me crash.  On some days it would make me feel foggy and other days I'd feel crisp and clear.  I also broke out with pimples on it.  You have to remind yourself to eat.  Some days I'd also have trouble falling a sleep.	"I would take 1 30mg pill in the morning at about 8am and then another 30mg pill at about 10am (sometimes trouble falling asleep if taken later).  I have done that for 2 months.  At the beginning I started off with only 1 pill a day.  I try to ""self administer"" my breaks in taking the medicine because I've heard it was addictive and I don't want to be addicted."

Nausea, depression, suicidal thoughts, vivid dreams	I built up the dosage like I was supposed to and took the twice daily dose for two days.  I spent both of those days unable to move because of the nausea, so my doctor recommended I drop down to .5 mg a day. On that small dosage I became very depressed and began having suicidal thoughts as well as very vivid dreams.  I went off the drug and then tried it again a few months later only to have the same depression issues. I'd rather keep smoking and try to find a new way to quit than to lose my life on this drug.

Finally threw up and took a nap and felt much better. I DID NOT know that the PG (in my vape juice) is why I felt so bad for the whole first 5 days.

I did not feel any relief from the depression, as a matter of fact, I felt worse.	I couldn't sleep at night and would fall asleep during the day.  It sometimes made me agitated too.	I really wasn't comfortable with taking Prozac in the first place - I had a crappy HMO doctor who thought giving me a pill would solve my problem.  I really just needed a change in my life (job, living in DC) to reverse my depression.  In other words, I think my depression was situational, not a chemical imbalance.  I know that these do work for many people, but I think it's imperative that a person know WHY they are depressed before they hit the pharmacy.

This is one of the safer ones-try to stick it out past the early symptoms, go slow, add 1 pill a week until you get up to where you need.

2035	protonix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic heartburn	The heartburn was unrelenting and multiple over the counter acid reducers were tried including taking the generic Over-The-Counter Prilosec twice per day. None of these medications seemed to caused any reduction in heartburn. After starting the Prontonix symptoms disappeared entirely within the first 24 hours. After starting the Protonix I was again able to eat and enjoy any type of food without heartburn, epigastric pain and nausea.	There were no side effects.	Protonix is taken once per day either with or without food. I take my prescription as bedtime.

1965	lyrica	5	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	spinal nerve compression pain	Perhaps a slight improvement in nerve pain	confusion, short term memory loss. It was like living in a fog.	I took it 3 times daily to help reduce nerve pain from spinal compression that needs to be fused but I did not want another fusion yet so this was one of the medications they put me on when nuerontin at the levels I needed caused some of the same side effects as Lyrica;.
3299	zoloft	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	I have seen a great improvement since taking Zoloft.  I am a classic type A person and tend toward anxiety when I have alot going on in my personal and professional life.  I asked my physician about Zoloft when my second child was 2 years old and I was under alot of stress at work.  I sleep much better, am more even tempered, and more optimistic when taking Zoloft.  Another benefit, probably due to my anxiety being under control, is that I think more clearly.  I don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work.	I need to take my dose with breakfast.  If not, I feel nauseous.  This hasn't been a huge issue, since I eat breakfast regularly.  However, if I take a pill and eat immediately, I feel sick to my stomach.  The only other issue I have had is that I feel dizzy if I miss a dose.  I am good at remembering to take my morning dose, so this does not happen often.   Also, I did go off Zoloft a couple of years ago because I wanted to reduce the number of drugs I was taking.  Although I gradually reduced my dosage, I had a difficult time when I finally went completely off.  I felt dizzy and suffered a couple of bouts of vertigo.	I take 75 mg in the morning.  Zoloft was prescribed to me by a family practice physician when I was 41 years old. The first 18 months that I took Zoloft, my dosage was 100 mg.  I took a break for about 2 years and asked my physician abbout going back on Zoloft last year, when I turned 45.  I was experiencing mood swings right before my period and, in doing research on the internet, learned that this could be due to my age.  One recommendation was treating the symptoms with zoloft or another prescription drug.  My physcian started me on 50 mg, and I went up to 75 mg after a few months of taking Zoloft.

429	imitrex	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	The drug did absolutely nothing for the pain or to lessen the time of the migraine.  The migraines were usually sseveral days long.	I experienced slightly more gagging while dry heaving and nausea changed to sickening feeling and more stomach churning.	Took Imitrex for a 3 month period and still had no noticeable results.  The tablet was suppose to lessen the pressure and pain if taken at onset of migraine.  I ended up trying Aleve and still take it to this day for migraines.
3090	minocycline	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I originally took the medication in a smaller dose for 3-4 months and saw a reduction of pus-filled pimples. The physician increased the dose to hopefully increase the benefits, as I still had significant acne.	After taking this medication for 1 week, I experienced sudden severe joint pain and stiffness, almost like very bad arthritis. I was 30 years old at the time.	I took this medication as prescribed by a dermatologist for 1 week at the 100 mg dose before severe side effects started. Side effects disappeared by 3 days after discontinuation.

1324	prevacid	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	eosinophilic esophagitis	It is difficult to discern if there were any real treatment benefits.  Our son was given Prevacid after being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in an attempt to stop frequent bouts of mid-night stomach pain.  It is possible the Prevacid had a mild-moderate impact on his stomach pain but more than likely it was the concurrent dietary modification.	There were no long-term side effects.  The first several evenings his stomach pain seemed to increase so the frequency was reduce to twice daily for the first 2 weeks.	Treatment consisted of Prevacid (1.25 mg) three times a day and at this time the duration is indefinite.  Concurrently his diet was modified, removing wheat, peanuts, dairy and beef, based on a blood based allergy test.  The next phase of evaluation will include a measured DTH response to the identified allergens.

At the time I started I was desperate & hopeless was quite surprised it helped as much as it did without usual side ffects of anti depressants-sexual sidew effects & weight gain.  Didn't cure depression but definitely helped severe suicidality.  And I'm against anti-depressants as 1st run for treating mood disorders but there is a place for them when exercise, sprirtual practice, good nutrition & life balance not enough-but these life practices absolutely indispensible for any health issue esp. Mood disorders.	Does have light stimulant effect which is great for the extreme fatige of depression But/And any activating chemical can also increase hostile, angry feelings so tweek the dose for you so you don't get over reactive with others.	Take 300 mg wellbutrin xr daily in morning, eat healthy whole foods, exercise-outdoors as much as possible, prayer; meditation, yoga, get rest, restructure negative beliefs into positive beliefs-cognitive & spiritual approaches

1902	doxycycline	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne with cystic fibrosis genetic condition	"Cleared up my Acne Vulgaris (acne turned into a big boil) and also coincidentally helped manage my lung condition. Usually I take ciprofloxacin 750mg twice a day, two weeks on and two weeks off for my CF, in addition to Azithromycin 250mg every day..BUT when I am off the Cipro i find that my lung condition very gradually deteriorates when I am not on Cipro. My finding was that when I was off the Cipro, and on the Doxycycline, the Doxycycline happen to help ""maintain""or slow down the exacerbation of my lung condition."	YES. Besides being more suceptable to sunburn, being in a tropical climate i felt I was VERY much more suceptable to heat exhaustion symptoms. I overcame this by taking double dosage of Salt tablets, and wearing a wet/cool towel around my neck to prevent the sun exposure on back of my neck. Wore a hat at all times also.	Doxycycline 100mg twice a day, after meals, with no milk for 1 mour before or after. To helpe with side effects I took 16-22 salt tablets per day (being in a tropical climate) plus panadol 2 tablets twice a day after meals. I found the panadol helped manage the symptoms of vertigo (mild dizzyness). I felt the panadol in low dosages also helped me recover quicker from excercise.

It works excellently in conjunction with a 2 week course of nebulised tobramycin (Tobi) to reduce symptoms and decrease sputum production. I believe one of its main actions is its anti inflammatory effect. Also I believe that it inhibits the ability of Pseudomonas to stick to the lungs. This is a great weapon in the arsenal against CF.

"I was diagnosed with a moderate to severe case of GERG with an esophageal hernia over 7 years ago, and spent two years at physicians request trying a mix of different OTC drugs.   NO OTC drug worked to stop the burning and the coughing after meals caused by GERD. I tried most everything you'd find in the OTC shelf in a drug store.  Tums, Zantac, etc. etc. etc.   Finally, doctor ordered Prilosec for me, 1/day, 20mg, taken in am before eating.  At that time Prilosec with still not yet over the counter, still requiring a physician prescription.  It worked beautifully and I have taken it since, daily.  If I don't take it, symptoms immediately occur after eating.   It does NOT however stop the cough that occurs after eating or otherwise from GERD. Recently, I have had to increase my dose ""occasionally"" to 1 pill also before dinner, but that is usually only if I'm eating later than expected.  I have never taken Nexium -- the HMO didn't cover it, but since Prilosec works so well, I don't feel the need to experiment."
4059	amoxil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	heart murmur/dental procedures	Since no such infection (i.e. endocarditis) ever occured after a dental procedure, the logical conclusion is that it was successful as an antidotal/ antibacterial treatment against (i.e.) endocarditis. However, I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years, also with no post-procedural infections.	Sleeplessness, easily bruised, diarrhea: the latter condition remained for up to a year or so AFTER I ceased taking Amoxicillin as a antibacterial antidote. I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years and the symptoms ceased. It's my understanding that this high-dosage, antidotal (dental) protocol is longer recommended.	To the best of my recollection (its been a while), the dentist(s) prescribed the 'standard' 2 - 4 500 mg. tablets to be taken 1 hour BEFORE any invasive procedure and the same dosage directly AFTER the procedure: cleaning, extraction, etc.: varying with dentist or procedure. I followed that procedure.

Overall taking amoxil was not nearly unpleasant as I thought it would have been and it did the job I was told it would do	side effects of treatment very rarely occurred and were minimal, however when I did experience side effects they were as follows : nausea, headache, stomach pain, dizziness, and loss of appetite.	I was told to take 3 500 mg pills a day over the course of a 7 day period in order to completely and effectively banish the infection, I felt comfortable with this decision and it turned out positive results in the end.

Then by the fourth to fifth month, I started to experience heart palpitations at an increasing rate daily.

I had began taking 20mg of Vyvanse for three months and was surprised to find that such a small dose affected my mood so effectively.  When it came to school work though I found that I needed the 30mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  I had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the 20mg.  I find that the greatest benefit of Vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before I was perscribed.

My side effects were inability to get any good sleep, taking forever to climax during sex, and never being able to get anything done. The overall feeling I felt was that everything just seemed blunted. Once I stopped the withdrawals were horrible. I felt hungover for about 4 days.

The first 3 days my hunger seemed to be less, but I think this was only due to a plecebo affect.	None that I could notice.  Then did not give me insomnia.	I was about 50 lbs overweight.  I was eating all the time, but mostly after about 9:00pm.  And I was always craving sweets.  I tried to get myself to the gym, but I was too tired all the time.  I tried other appetite suppresents, like hoodia, but nothing seemed to work.  The I finally talked the doctor in to prescribing me phentermine.  She was reluctant because I have high  blood pressure and I take medicine for that.  But I took my blood pressure everyday for the 3 months and I had NO increase in pressure as long as I took my medicine.  Unfortunately, after the three months, I had only lost 5 lbs. which, I always seemed to fluctuate anyway.  So to recap, phentermine did absolutely nothing for me.

There was some drowsiness after taking the capsule, and therefore it was taken at night.	One capsule per day, taken in the evening.

There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.	It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall.	"""Today is my first day using Retain A 0.04% microderm Gel. I work in a pharmacy and the Rph told me when using this gel I have to also use clindamyacin 1% lotion before the gel. She also told me to use minocycline 100 mg capsules as well. Anyway , she said it will work alone but will work excellent together( gel &amp; lotion). Then the capsules will top it off. My face (due a thyroidectomy that was performed) was always CLEAR.

The treatment dramatically lessened the effect of nicotine withdrawal, or at least its perception, such that any reflexive craving to smoke was manageably overcome until the habit was finally broken.	"At 150mg/d side effects were minimal - perhaps a slight boost in energy. In contrast, at 300mg/d - which I could handle for only a short period - I felt ""shaky"" with restless legs and some insomnia. These problems went away when I reverted to 150mg/d. I feel the treatment was entirely effective at this lower dose, and unmanageably unpleasant at the higher [and recommended!] dose. Perhaps Zyban should revisit their dosing recommendations."

After 5 years of taking this drug, my father has developed short term memory loss which has developed to the point he now has an alzheimer's diagnosis for himself.

"Due to a recent mix up at the pharmacy, my father was accidentally withdrawn from the drug and suffered a terrible withdrawal.  After 10 days without oxazepam, his memory improved but the doctor put him right back on it.  I have since tried to get the doc to take him off.  His answer?  What's the point at his age.  Why not just let him drift away in a foggy twilight.

1888	doxycycline	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Treatment for three conditions all in one drug.	Stomach upset, sun sensitivity.	I'm unlucky to have three conditions that affect the attractiveness of my face.  I've struggled with acne since youth, and I've also had chronic blepharitis since age 12.  I am not heading into my 30's, and I'm beginning to develop rosacea on my upper cheeks, which could be contributing to my blepharitis.  Some days, I just don't feel like leaving the house because of how I look.  Doxycycline has helped clear up the acne and the rosacea symtoms.  However, it wasn't as affective at treating my blepharitis, so I'm not going to try a topical antibiotic, which has worked in the past.
2740	actonel	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	loss of bone mass	The loss of bone mass retarded. It is difficult to measure the efficacy of the drug apart from a bone scan.  I do not nor have ever broken a bone. Considering my weakness in my wrists this drug may be credited with bone integrity.	Dry mouth, slight constipation,  but rarely any other.  I did not do well with Fosomax, so was given Actonel, and then a once a month Actonel.. My Health Care program persuaded me to take the generic once a week, because it was cheaper.  I find no difference in the once a week or once a month side effects.	Actonel or its generic is taken to stop bone loss- which is especially prevalent in thin white older women. It is a pill taken once a week on an empty stomach upon rising in the morning.  After the pill is taken with an 8 oz glass of water, the patient must remain upright  for 30 minutes. It is a bit of a nuisance not to be able to lie down after taking the pill, and to have wait for 30 minutes before the coffee that is brewing and smells so tantalizing is wafting through the house can be drunk!

A few idiots abuse this drug and thus the drug has gotten a bad rap unfortunately. Much better than SSRI's with way less side effects. It really makes me feel great.

I eat one or two small snacks during the day, but at night I will have a meal when the medication begins to wear off. I also drink alot more fluids due to the dry mouth, which is another side effect. Neither of these side effects are bothersome though. I could afford to lose an additional 20 pounds and i'm hoping vyvanse can help me with that. I used to OVER eat, and now i eat only when my body needs the energy, which is good.	"overall I would definitely suggest vyvanse if you are unhappy with your current ADD meds, or if you are thinking about seeing a doctor concerning ADD. I will say that if you are your child is under 18, or irresponsible concerning ""drugs"" be careful and keep an eye on your childs consumption. Even though they say vyvanse is non-addicting, the feeling while on it and the persona it gives is very much desireable in comparison to not taking it. Also, if you are already under weight you should try a natural stimulant like stratera instead."

Side effects were horrific. I gained weight, developed horrible acne, and i was severely depressed the entire time. When choosing the depo shot i was excited to not have to worry about taking the pill, lightening or stopping my periods, and the guaruntee of contraception. Boy was i wrong. All of the previous side effects were bad enough, but after the first month on the shot, i continued to have my period for nearly 2 months straight. for some reason my period never stopped. The worst part about this contraceptive is that once you take the shot, there is no going back. I highly recommend a different birth control. I am now on the nuvaring and so far i am pleased with the results. Mild nausea at night the first week but that is my only complaint. Much better choice if you are looking to avoid pills. :)	I recieved the shot at family planning about 3 years ago. Please do yourself a favor and look to other options before choosing this drug.

I have experienced no side effects with Imitrex.	At the onset of pain or even if migraine is full-blown, take one tablet with water and lie down if possible. Pain is reliefed within 30 minutes.

Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 

Another benefit was that I did not get upper GI pain & bleeding with this med, whereas NSAIDs had been causing black stools due to GI irritation & bleeding."	Within about 30 minutes of taking each dose of Sulindac, I experienced a colicky pain under my ribs on the right side.  The pain was not extreme, but it was noticeable and unpleasant.  Duration lasted 2 - 4 hours each time.  This side effect persisted throughout the entire treatment period.	"Due to longstanding knee osteoarthritis, I am prone to fluid-filled cysts on the backside of my knees.  The cysts cause pain, swelling, and reduced circulation to the lower leg.  The cysts interfere with walking gait as well.

In past I had used NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation of these cysts, however due to NSAID-related side effects, this class of drug was put off-limits by my physician.  His recommendation was that I try a drug in the pro-NSAID class, which is less irritating to the stomach.

In retrospect, I think that for me, the Sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the Sulindac.  Due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.  My response to the Sulindac was less robust than I had hoped for -- much less improvement than I had experienced previously with NSAIDs -- and it also took a long time (3 weeks) to reach the level of improvement that in past I would achieve in 3 days with OTC NSAIDs."

It gives me the reassurance that I'm not pregnant because usually my periods would be almost half a month to a month late. Also, I have yet to become pregnant, but I still use additional protection at all times.	None. I don't understand how it could bring about side effects really. It doesn't cause weight gain. If you gain weight on this, it's your own fault for eating too much! =] The only thing I can think of is when I go to the bathroom it comes out a bit, but nothing that can't be fixed immediately. Never come completely out yet without me physically removing it.	Simple. I would 100% recommend this.
2045	prempro	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	menopausal symptoms, especially night sweats	Night sweats greatly reduced within a week, from 3-5 strong episodes a night (and associated sleep disturbance) to 0-1 a night (mostly in the early a.m.) and less severe and shorter duration.	Increase in bloating, increased feeling of needing to urinate (every hour or so, but often very little urine production) and quite frequent discomfort, mostly at the end of urination. Tiredness persists, which is odd as I have been sleeping quite a lot better.	My ob-gyn recommended I try this for 3 months, but if the negative effects still persist by the end of the current month I will probably stop taking it.
1016	estrace	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	vaginal dryness	reduction of hot flashes, and reduction of vaginal dryness. I'd already been trying a vaginal estrogen ring, but this wasn't enough of a dose for me, apparently. Since taking out the ring, which I'd had in for 6 months, and using the cream instead, things have been a lot better (i.e. less dryness, and less pain with intercourse. Yay!	none	.5 mg cream into vagina, 3 nights per week
2422	synthroid	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	The drug Levothyroxine 100 mics daily that I took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. I did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where I felt lithargic and brain dead.If I inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, I felt like I would notice my sluggishness a few days later.	I had no side effects.	I have since stopped taking the Levothyroxine 100 mics daily. My provider explained to me since I was still feeling tired was to switch to the brand name Synthroid 100 mics daily. I have noticed a big difference in my energy level and alertness. I can't believe I have gone this long (15 years) feeling tired and out of sorts. I wish now I had been taking the brand name all along. No telling what things I may acomplished.

However,  it seems important to share our experience based on the severity of his reaction that day and that multiple reports of similar exist. I do not recommend the &quot;headache cocktail&quot; of Benadryl and Compazine together and hope the number of similar reports are looked into."""
1633	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hrt	Alleviation of post hysterectomy depression and other post menopause symptoms.	Some headaches at the beginning of the treatment.  Some breast tenderness initially.	Three months after my hysterectomy in 1998 I was hospitalized with severe depression.   The depression went away shortly after starting the Premarin.

Find I don't think about having a smoke when first get up or right after eating all the time.  But I still do have cravings at times.  The cravings are manageable.	Only side effect was in the first couple of days, I would feel light headed at times.  I have dreams I remember now verses not remembering them before the drug.  Any other side effect could be contributed to the other medicines I have to take so I can't say if the mood swings or sleeping habits are due to the Chantix.  Major side effect is the cost.  This drug costs two and half times as much as my smoking habit per month.	I did the starter packet for the first seven days as prescriped.  Now I am on the 1mg twice a day.
1136	methadone	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	opiate addiction	I no longer have to rely on drug dealers to make it through the day. I went back to school, and I feel great about myself.

1755	topamax	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	seizure/migraine	I was prescribed this medicine by my neurologist who prescribed it to treat both seizures and migraine headaches. The medicine was very effective. In the 6 month period I was on the medicine, I only experienced 3 seizures compared to my normal 3 a week. Migraine headaches were also reduces, only apparent if triggered by something severe.	soda tasted horrible, and I had an extreme loss of appetite. No matter how badly I wanted to I was unable to eat more than a few bites of food. This caused me to lose 25 pounds, dropping me to 5'6 and under 100 pounds. Worse than the effect on my diet was how it effected my cognitive processes. I became unable to think clearly. Solving problems in my head was nearly impossible. Complete loss of focus and concentration. Extreme forgetfulness. Inability to structure sentences properly.  Very emotional, which is highly uncharacteristic of me.	While the medicine was successful in treating both seizures and migraines, being a college student the side effects became too unbearable to continue the medication. My grades began to slip, and discontinuing the medication became necessary.

Resolution of symptoms within 48 hours.	None.	"The drug was started within 24 hours of first symptoms. Following the advice on the packet the tablets were always taken with food ( single serve cheese and crackers ) and some gatorade. I was careful to maintain hydration with Gatorade brand drink. First dose was late afternoon so set alarm clock to wake at 3 am for next dose rather than waiting till i woke up naturally which given my tired state may well have missed a dose then pushed each dose back by 2-3 hours until they were being taken at times more agreable to the bodyclock.

Unfortunately cough returned after skipping a dose on the 4th day of the standard 5 day course. Resolved after 2 doses again so got another packet and continued for 2 days more until symptom free for 24 hours."
3898	dispermox	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	jaw abscess	"I had an infected jaw, an abcess under a back molar that inflamed the entire left side of my lower jaw producing a large ping pong ball sized swelling. This was probably -- my dentist suggested -- due to an infected tooth root that had migrated to jaw tissue.
After taking the drug, the swelling started to lessen in about 36 hours and progressively lessened over the next 5 days until it was not visible."	I felt a sense of fatigue, low energy and slightly depressed.	Dentitst recommend root canal, and proscribed codeine should have any pain as well as another round of the antibiotic.
763	flonase	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	runny nose/ allergies	The runny nose would stop about 30 minutes after I used flonase, but would return again within hours after taking the medication. It definitely cleared my sinuses, but sometimes left my nose feeling dry. Probably better as a sinus clearer than at alleviating all allergy symptoms.	There were no treatment side effects.	Treatment only involved twice a day use, squirting the liquid up each nostril. Not inconvenient at all.
2486	mirtazapine	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	clinical depression	Did improve my appetite, which was suffering as a result of the depression.	Mild weight gain. Period of tiredness for two hours or so after each dose. Very hard to wake up in the mornings.	Was prescribed as an alternative to Citalopram. Had virtually no effect on my depression whatsoever. In the period of winding down the Citalopram dose then the 7 weeks on Mirtazapine I went from mildly depressed / just about coping to suicidal, unable to cope and deeply depressed most of the time. Would advise anyone who gets rapidly worsening depression after a med change to see the doctor again far sooner than I did.
628	nortriptyline	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks/feeling low	very little benefit, slept a bit better, still got anxiety, cant always sleep, offered valium as well for bad days, good days are wonderful, stressful time isnt over yet so body still goes into panic	dry mouth, thirst	25mg more than one month, given more for another month, unsure of the benefits, need to ask a professional about amitryptiline
3105	ortho-tri-cyclen	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I was given this birth control to help stabilize my hormones to aid in clearing up my acne.  I never saw a significant improvement in my acne.	"I suffered some very negative side effects.  First, this medication made me nauseated.  Secondly, and the effect that I am still trying to recover from, this medication gave me the ""pregnancy mask"" which is a darkening above the lip area."	I was to take this birthcontrol pill daily to aid in the hormonal fluctuations that possibly were contributing to my acne.
881	paxil	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	"Significant reduction in feelings of anxiety, angry feelings, and social anxiety. Normalizing of affect, increased ability to focus on tasks and to cope with minor stressors. I felt a sort of reorganization of my thought processes, no longer brooded interminably about minor failings or ineffective social interactions or the presumed opinions of others about my worth. No longer hypervigilant about social cues. ""So this is what it's like to be normal!"""	"Initially, but eventually disappearing side effects: drowsiness, severe nausea, inability to achieve orgasm, trembling, lack of affect. When failing to take medication, ""brain shocks"" like electrical lightning in brain."	Took 20 mg of paroxetine each morning (easier to remember in the morning). Reviewed effectiveness with prescribing physician every 3 months.
3845	voltaren	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sore lower back	There was a complete reduction of back pain, and the inflammation. I wasn't sure what was causing it at the time- ie. back strain or period pain or?? but the Voltaren made me able to walk and sit comfortably again	nausea- I forgot to eat enough before taking the dose, and by the time I though tof it the nausea had settled in. It took a couple of hours to wear off.	I self diagnosed and took what seemed to be the approriate minimum dose, aware that it wouldn't be good to take long term.

2192	clonazepam	4	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety/insomnia/	I took it when my husband of 30 years left me and my 4 kids for another woman.  I couldn't sleep, eat or function.  The klonopin helped me sleep, which helped me function. I probably would have committed suicide without it.	I first noticed that I had trouble memorizing things.  It was the trouble with equilibrium and balance that motivated me to get off of it.  I got to the point where I was a little unsteady walking with flats.  I also had morning grogginess, which would gradually get better by lunch time.	It was hard weaning off because of the insomnia that insued. Once I got off my fibromyalgia got much better, the memory improved, and the disequilibrium slowly improved.
1169	nasarel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rhinitis	Prior to using this spray, I had year round nasal problems: unable to breathe out of one or both nostrils.  The symptoms were particularly bad during the summer, and whenever I was in a laying down position.  The symptoms greatly interfered with my sleep.  When using this spray on a regular basis, my nostrils are completely clear most of the time, and I have minimal nasal problems during my allergy season.		"""Golf for me is not possible when the grass in the roughs is in bloom without allergy help. I need three medications: an antihistimine such as Loratadine (Claritin) or Cetirizine (Zyrtec) to minimize reaction to the pollen overall, cromolyn drops for my eyes to keep them from being irritated and Nasarel to prevent the pollen from bringing on the uncontrolled sneezing. With all three, I can comfortably be in an environment that otherwise would compel me to leave the course and wait hours or even days to recover."""
2295	lexapro	6	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.	On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.	The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.
3696	effexor-xr	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	clinical depression	I could not see any benefits. I certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before.	This medication plunged me into experiencing menopausal symptoms. i took a blood test and my GP told me that I was not menopausal and gave me under arm deodorant which stung for the excessive sweating. My skin became extremely dry. I have no more natural vaginal secretions. My hair became very dry and I am experiencing small bald patch sin the front hair line.my sleeping pattern is absolutely awful. I look tired and haggard all the time, with enormous eye bags.The pain in my knees became a lot more severe	"I was prescribed this medication when the medication I had been taking for 2 and a half years became ineffective. I was not informed of any side effects. Every time I went to my GP to discuss symptoms which I was worried about, they just patronised me.

I no longer take any medication for my condition and although I do not consider myself to be well, some of my symptoms have reduced. The others such as incontinence, dry skin, lack of natural seretions, I am just trying to live with or trying to find products which I hope will one day help me."
3917	nexium	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd with laryngeal spasms	almost complete elimination of gerd symptoms--reflux,heartburn,nausea,choking spasms, cough.  I have also been able to eat a wider variety of foods without discomfort.	Little to no side effects.  Occasional stomach discomfort,gas, diarrhea, but these could also be associated with irritable bowel syndrome.  All in all, very few problems with this medication compared to its benefits.	Previously took Losec, but continued to have problems with choking spasms, which became increasingly distressing.  The doctor prescribed Nexium at a lower dose, 30 mg., which helped but did not eliminate symptoms.  Increased to 40, and have been happy with this dose ever since.  The doctor tried reducing it once, but I had a choking spasm within two weeks, so we increased it again.  She was a little concerned about risk of osteoporosis, but bone density tests have been normal.
2081	metformin	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pcos	I noticed that I was feeling better and my menstrual cycle was more regular. My skin cleared up as well and I felt more energetic.	There are times that I would feel nauseous and diarrhea. Another thing that bothered me with this medicine is the smell of the pills, it made me really nauseous and disgusted, I have to plug my nose to take them.	If you do not eat right and take the medicine, I think there is no point. My advice would be to eat healthy, exercise (even if you just walk) and take this medicine you will see results.
1087	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"I did not experience the ""brain-fog"" that I did with Celexa. I felt great after the first couple of days - relieved the depression immensely."	I was one of the few who experienced severe constipation from taking Effexor. Thankfully, this side-effect abated after two weeks. I've also noticed that just one of my eyes appears to have decreased in visual accuity - from 20/20 to maybe 20/30-40.	After using Celexa for 7 years, it decreased in its helpfulness. Celexa always made me feel like I was in a fog as well - hated the stuff. Immediately after taking Effexor, I felt the fog lift and I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am,  or how greatly that improveed the quality of my life. I still have moments where I feel a little anxious, but as a whole, the depression is being taken care of. When I noticed a decrease in visual accuity in my right eye, I stopped taking the drug. My eyesight seemed to return to normal. Oddly, my left eye is fine, but it was always extraordinarily good.
2104	renova	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti aging	At first, there was some minor improvement in the texture of my skin but then it began to degrade the area around my eye. The skin became thinner in appearance and more and more dry. It seemed to be harming my skin. At that point my dermotologist said my skin may be too sensitive. I do not feel that I have sensitive skin because while I may have a pale color skin, it has a olive tone. I do not sunburn very easily. Then I switched to ROC but had similar results.	Dry and thinning skin.	"I followed the directions which were to increase it gradually.
Another drug that I have had success with is hydroquinone. It does bleach out my melasma very well but it takes perservance and regularity in its application."
215	lo-ovral	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne and contraception	Within days, the acne disappeared. When taken continuously for 3-5 months at a time, the acne never reappeared and the hirsutism decreased substantially.  We then added laser hair removal and stopped the spironolactone.	Spironolactone caused occasional leg cramping.  The Lo-ovral caused some water retention.	Spironolactone was taken 50 mg a day and then increased after 3 months to 100 mg twice a day.  The Lo-ovral was taken each day.  The laser hair removal was every 6 weeks.  The acne was completely under control.  When the OCP was stopped, the acne returned.
469	remicade	7	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	crohns disease, psoriatic arthritis	skin and joints were better	I could not breath during treatment; first time was fine, 2nd and 3rd times treatment could not be completed; vomiting, felt like throat/lungs were closing up.	"""My son started Remicade at 13yrs. He has severe Crohns flare ups and this was a last resort aside from surgery for him. The Remicade treatment gave him few side effects. He didn&#039;t get any headaches/tiredness. And he didn&#039;t get sick easier like they said he would. When almost our whole house(7 of us) got the flu; m\Micah didn&#039;t. Micah just took his last dose 8 weeks ago after being on Remicade for over a year and a half. (Micah was on Lialda too) even when they used the amount of Remicade, Micah was still getting flare ups every other month or so. They tested his blood and found out he had antibodies to the Remicade, which means his body was attacking the Remicade and that&#039;s why it was only working right after the infusions."""
2427	synthroid	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	hypothyriod	none, I was very disappointed at the time because the doctor said that it going to take care of my problem. I had no energy.	It just didn't work and that was the side affects.	"""While it brought the TSH into the appropriate range, the exhaustion, lethargy, constipation, etc. was unbearable.  For 20 hours out of the day, felt drowsy, unmotivated and sleepy.  This is no way to live.  Got on Tirosint and what a difference."""
430	imitrex	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine headaches	Imitrex usually reduced the headache severity, if I was able to take it at the first sign of a headache. If I took it later, Imitrex might help somewhat but often not enough.	I was often tired after a severe headache. Otherwise, I didn't notice too many side effects.	"""Imitrex does the trick of getting rid of my migraine every time, but the side effects are a little rough.  I feel as though my neck and chest are tightening and achy, but if I go to sleep about 10 minutes after taking Imitrex. I miss the side effects happening to me, and just wake up feeling better."""
3465	ambien-cr	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	Immediate ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.  No side effects in the morning.	I have to take the drup on an empty stomach.  Very bad side effects if taken with alcohol.  Taken alone, side effects were increased night eating and loss of memory after taking the medication.  If you do not go to sleep immediately you may drive or do things without using good sense.	Treatment is 12.5 miligrams for an indefinate period of time.
3981	amitiza	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ibs	My stomach aches went away. I wasn't as nauseated as I would have been without anything.	I have been getting headaches sporadically and the doctor said this is a possbile side effect. Also, I was very nauseated the first 2 weeks, which they say happens in 30% of the population taking this drug, but then it subsided.	"""Amitiza has saved my life...seriously. My problem was so bad that I was in danger of rupturing my  colon.  I ended up in ER and they could not help me so they had to admit me. Needless to say drinking a gallon of nasty stuff and the most embarrassing procedure of my life....i stayed up all night and when they discharged me the Dr gave me Amitiza to take 2 a day. I would recommend you start at 8mg and see how that works.  24 for me took some getting adjusted to so I took 1 a day and if no bm then i took the 2nd.  Right now if I do  not take 2 a day....I have problems...serious problems. But for me Amitiza is $24 for 60 but I would pay 200 if that is what it took to NEVER go back to ER with this problem"""

I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear.	None noticed	One 500mg tablet twice a day

The dose and length of treatment was very managable, it was easy to remember to take one dose each day.

I also take ADHD medication so the side effect of hunger is not an unwelcome thing, should note that at higher doses (30mg ) it works more as an antidepressant and around 15mg it has a nice effect on appetite stimulation and sedation to sleep.  You don&#039;t feel as if you&#039;re in a fog, you just feel &quot;balanced&quot; I suppose.  You feel emotions but they&#039;re not as extreme, doesn&#039;t have that zombie effect.

My dog died and I had chest pains and other Gerd-esque symptoms. I went to doc, they gave me a sample of Prilosec. I began on it and developed the problems. I stopped taking it for about two days, I started feeling bleh and the symptoms Prilosec caused started to go away. To make sure it was the Prilosec, I took it again.

The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 
As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep. Considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect."	"I'm very slow to get going in the morning. I often hit my snooze alarm 10-12 times (only 5 minutes a piece), but that could also stem from setting my alarm 3 hours before I have to be anywhere.

The worst problem of it all is that it stuffs up my sinuses to the point where I can't breathe through them when getting to sleep. Combine that with dry mouth and you get some very uncomfortable nights. I've found that keeping a supply of corn chips and water next to my bed counteracts the dry mouth until I go unconscious and stop caring.

Also, something which I'm not sure if I can blame the seroquel for; I sometimes get very mild but discomforting pains just under my left collarbone. Not like heart-chest pain (from what I'd imagine it's like), but a different pain. Hopefully my heart doesn't explode randomly."	"Dec 08- Zoloft, sparked a 3 week long mixed phase with psychotic features. 4 days into it I was prescribed 25 mg seroquel.

Jan 09-April 09, Increasing doses of Seroquel, up to 300. Also Wellbutrin, starting at 50 and eventually reaching 300. The wellbutrin made me considerably more depressed than I was before, and I stopped taking it. Since then it's been the seroquel, and I've been mostly stable since."
3577	differin	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	elarge pores blackheads around nose & cheeks	The Differin did seem to help clear up the occasional blemishes I would get. made a slight improvement in the size of blackheads on my nose and cheeks but didn't aleviate them entirely.	My skin became more sensitive although this happened after about a week of use not in the beginning. There were times when my skin felt warm. My skin peeled a little bit and felt and appeared dry. There was some periodic itching. My skin became more sensitive and something like a scrape would hurt. Additionally and most noticeably even though I avoided my eye area the differin would make the skin around my eyes sore, red and flaky. I'm not sure how it spread to my eyes when I avoided rubbing it in anywhere close, but it did.	I was directed to apply once or twice a week and build up to once per night as tolerated. I was able to tolerate once per night application for the entire course of treatment. There were some negative side effects (itching, sensitivity, warmth, and redness especially around my eyes) and not much in the way of positive side effects. I am now considering asking my dermatologist for a different prescription.
3524	lunesta	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleeping problems	Was able to fall asleep within 30 minutes of taking Lunesta.  Stayed asleep for at least 4 hours to 10 hours.	Bad taste in mouth before falling asleep, sleeping too long (10-14 hours), having difficulty waking up after 8 hours or less.	Due to having depression, Prozac and the anxiety would interfere with sleeping patterns.  I take Lunesta as needed to try to correct my sleeping habits.  Since I was sleeping too long and having difficulty waking up, I usually only take half a tablet of Lunesta now.
3809	solodyn	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	Solodyn virtually eliminated any acne I had, both on my face and body.  It took about a month to see dramatic results, but some results were visible within a few days of starting the medication.	I didn't experience any side effects until about four weeks into treatment, at which time I began breaking out in very mild hives.  They were so mild, in fact, that I originally thought they may have been caused by a lotion or cosmetic that had gotten on my skin, or maybe by something I had eaten.  The hives would come and go throughout the day, appearing very sparsely on my face, neck, and/or hands.  A few days passed, and I realized that they must have been caused by the drug, so I stopped taking it and the hives went away after a day or so.  I want to stress that these hives were very mild.  I have had allergic reactions to drugs in the past (which may have made be more susceptible this time) and every previous experience I've had with drug-related hives has been much, much worse and possibly life-threatening if not treated.  Perhaps that would have been the case with these as well if I had continued taking the drug, but they didn't seem to be particularly alarming, just mildly annoying.	"""I just wanted to share the info I got from my doctor. I just got prescribed this medication today. Some people on here mentioned headaches, nausea and tanning both of which my doctor told me could be some side effects. Hope that helped!  I hope this medicine helps me."""

3277	zoloft	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety/panic attacks	made my daughter less anxious	made my daughter numb to normal social skill development	My daughter began having school/social anxiety when she was about 9.  She is dyslexic too.  She was put on Zoloft to help control her anxiety and panic attacks.  I think it helped, however she became numb to a lot of social norms.  She never did anything terrible, but I always felt that she would do something inappropriate.  We d/c her Zoloft at the beginning of the summer of 2007.  We weaned her off per the dr's instructions.  She is much more normal now.  Minor anxiety and a lot more normal as far as social skills and obeying social norms.
3311	zoloft	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	nerves, depression	I felt calmer and my overall outlook was better. It was subtle...still had some nerve problems and anxiety, but my guess is thats because it does not erase problems...but you can tolerate them better over the long haul.	none that I noticed.	I had alot of grief and was nervous at work, so my MD gave me this medicine to help with those problems.  It did help a bit with the physical nerve problem...less jittery and all that...but it didnt stop it completely.  I was able to function and not feel light headed or fuzzy...which I did not want. So that was a plus...I stayed on it for aprox 1 year...then lost my healthcare insurance so I no longer take it.
55	flexeril	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic musculoskeletal pain (neck/back)	Some pain relief, only significant benefit was during severe breakthrough pain and/or muscle spasms.  Excellent sleep aid.	Marked drowsiness.  Mild intoxicated/sedated type feeling.	"Provided pain relief but only during times of severe pain or spasm.  Made me very drowsy; if I had to take it during the day I would break the tablet in half and take 5mg instead.  This still provided a significant amount of relief with less drowsiness.  
Worked great as a sleep aid; not only did it knock me out but it also promotes proper sleep stage patterns that SSRI antidepressants disrupt.  Has a noticeable hangover effect in the morning however."
3737	lamictal	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bipolar ii	The drug stabilized my rapid cycling.  It facilitated my reducing alcohol consumption to decrease my hypomanic symptoms.	I had severe suicidal thoughts, severe depression and feelings of isolation, and absolutely no motivation for life.  FDA has issued statement that patients are twice as likely to experience suicidal thoughts/ideation on this drug than on placebo.  Unfortunately, I was on this drug for 15 months before this information was released and an additional 7 months before I read about it.  My psychiatrist (outside the U.S.) was not notified about this potential side effect.  I feel like I lost almost two years of my life.	"QD A.M.: 150 mg Wellbutrin

235	wellbutrin-xl	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Greatly benefitted depression. I started to take this just before my child was born, having had post partum depression with another baby, and I was anticipating my life to be at least as hectic, if not more hectic, when this child was born as when the older child was born. I was very  pleased with the antidepressant effects. I never experienced any depression at all once this baby was born. I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline, which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born.	Wellbutrin can make me feel anxious, which is why I have a prescription for clonazepam whenever I am taking wellbutrin. The worst side effect was the cost. I have no health insurance and wellbutrin xl is very expensive. I did not notice weight loss, as some others have, nor did I ever notice an increase in my libido. I tolerated it very well.	"I started to take wellbutrin xl at about six months of pregnancy and continued for approx six months, when the baby was about three months old. I usually took it in the morning, but often times forgot and took it later in the day. None of this seemed to affect how well it worked. Were it not for the fact that it is so expensive and that it can be toxic to the body, I would take it every day.

I have noticed releif from the soreness and stiffness that comes with this problem. Other than that I don't know what else I can tell you about this drug. Since there are fewer drugs available for this problem that are effective it has also been shown to be safe.	The only side effects of takibg this drug are some stomach irritation. I have found that if I take it with food it helps. The manufacturers of this drug claim that there are no side effects involving the stomach but I would disagree with this claim.	"I have been taking Celebrex for over 5 years. As it is an expensive drug I probably would not be taking it unless it werew provided free by my doctor. I notice that I feel much better when I have been taking it for a few days but because of the side effect of stomach irritation I usually have to stop taking it for a few days to let me stomach return to normal.

2785	keppra	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	for epilepsy	We aren't sure.  We wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  The goal is to get her back under complete control.	The main side effect we noticed with Keppra was weight loss.  She dropped 20 lbs. in less than a month.  She had a very suppressed appetite for the first 6 or 7 months.  She has since gained back maybe 5 lbs. but continues to have a suppressed appetite just not as much as at first.

After taking for 3 days I could feel the effects, I was much calmer and able to handle stressful situations, and back to myself. My problem was that small daily stresses tended to become much larger than they should have. I am now much more able to let small things roll off my back.	I have gained weight.

While it made sneezing and watery eyes diminish, it did not address the issue of respiratory difficulties.  I found that it may have even increased my respiratory symptoms in this process.	I felt ditzy while on the drug and had a hard time sleeping.  I also felt the waves of how this drug would work and it was sometimes frustrating.	I was to take one allegra per day to help alleviate pet allergies.

1182	prozac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for 20 years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all.	initial dosage was 20 mgs. each morning.  this dosage was sufficient for about 5 years, at which point it was raised to 40 mgs. each day.  ultimately, the dosage was raised again approximately 2-3 years after the first increase to my current dosage of 60 mgs. each day.  this is apparently the maximum dosage.  only side effect was loss of libido.	basically you need to see a psychiatrist as often as your condition requires.  i also recommend concurrent visits with some type of therapist or counselor, as this will increase the benefits you receive by taking the medication.
1094	effexor	9	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	"I've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest I ever came to a ""cure"". 
Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference."	As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time.	"I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission."

This is a one amazing medicine. I&#039;m at the point with it now, that I can barely take 2.5 mg, (5mg cut in half) without feeling drugged up though. My body became very sensitive from it. You may gain some weight on this medicine. It does give you the munchies. However, I did weight watchers on this medicine and was able to take off some weight.

Was put on clonazepam - worst feeling ever; 2 mg daily, extreme tiredness, couldn't function doing daily activities. Dropped down to 1mg per script; same effect as taking 2mg.

2256	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.	Initially the medication made me very drowsy. I began taking it at bedtime, which seemed to eleviate that particular concern.  I think there may have been some weight gain, but I am not certain that it was specifically related to the Lexapro. Also, I did initially have difficult acheiving orgasm, but this side effect seemed to diminish within 6-9 months.	I'm not sure waht you mean here- I started on the medication over 2 years ago at 10 mg a day. The dosage was increased to 20 mg after about 12 months.  The side effects were limited, and mostly not perticularly bothersome.

I also had a head injury and it seemed to help in the recovery from that.	In the beginning, I had loss of appetite, and become tired.  But that ended after about two weeks.	I had one on one counseling with a therapist.  I have taken 20 mg everyday for the past 12 years.  I have tried other medications but they have not worked nearly as well for me.

The treatment consist of going to a Gastroenterologist, A physician who specializes in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.

I had to subsequent surgeries during the following 5 months. Was taking in conjunction with narcotics right after surgery and for a week or so, then only the Celebrex. After about one year, it was reduced down to once a day. I noticed if I didn't take the medication my shoulder would consistantly ache at about a 3-4 out of 10 pain scale. With the medication, I would rate the pain as 0-1, not really noticeable, but still there.
3715	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bi-polar 2	I feel much more stabilized on this drug. However the 200 mg.did quit working after about year and a half, and I was hospitalized with a mixed episode. My Lamictal was raised to 400 mg. 200 at night and 200 in the AM. I am told this is the highest theraputic level for this drug for treating bi-polar. I am much more even but am also still on Geodon and kolonpin once a day. I am weaning off of zoloft-am at 50 mg. once a day at moment. I feel the real med that has helped is the Lamictal, I hope to wean off the rest of meds after being stable for a length of time.	I do not think I have or had any side affects. It is hard to tell because I am on more than one drug, and while in the hospital I was on others. I am also alcholic so like that Lamictal is not habit forming. I am afraid I will put on weight as others have reported.	"""Vivid dreams, nightmares, night terrors, sleep paralysis, frequent awakenings during sleep, thought blocking, memory lapses, word retrieval problems, concentration. Sleep disorders eventually fade but they were certainly debilitating. After 200 mg my mother reported I had strange behavior a few times that I don&#039;t remember. Besides these side-effects it has a very noticeable effect on depression. I would risk all those adverse reactions for this pill. Saved my life."""

The Flexeril was effective in relaxing my muscles enough to make this merely a slight sensation within about twenty minutes, and over aperiod of one two two months the problem went away entirely.	I do not feel that I experienced any truly negative side effects or have any adverse reactions to the Flexeril.  If I was tired, the muscle relaxing effect would end up making me sleepy, and if I took it right before going to sleep it might be a little harder to wake up in the morning. But, to me it seems like that just meant it was doing what it was intended to do.	"""I am a 39 year old Male and injured my back and neck about 7 years ago in a terrible car accident.

2302	lexapro	6	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.	On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.	The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.

General tiredness, I try to work out about 3 times per week.  But I still ran 2 miles about 5 days ago.  I will say that I sleep MUCH better since I started taking DORYX.

Doryx totally and completely has changed my life. I rarely even get a pimple around the time of my period anymore. When I first started Doryx, (5 months ago) I was taking 150 mg daily.

I have had the same problem with some other drugs (primarily antibiotics)where the generic was not effective but the brand name product worked fine.
1216	prozac	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mild depression and anxiety	So far, I have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and PMS symptoms.  I can't say it's all due to the Prozac, as I'm employing CBT methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and I generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  I'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms I'm experiencing.  It's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when I don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring.	Immediately after beginning treatment I experienced heartburn and nausea that would come in waves all day long.  Due to this, I lost 6 pounds in a 3 week period (worrisome because I am a normal weight).  About a week and a half later the nausea started to subside, but then I noticed I was feeling very stimulated. It was as if I could actually feel energy rushing in my body, and had to keep moving or get up and do something with myself. Soon after this began, I started experiencing trembling and tremors/twitches in my hands, arms, legs, feet, and neck.  Generally the tremoring subsides when I am up and moving, (e.g. walking), but when I start to relax (e.g. sitting or lying down) I tend to feel it more.  At first there was a twitch here and there, but now it happens very frequently and all over.  No sexual side effects noted yet.	I was prescribed Prozac for managing mild depression and anxiety attacks in conjunction with weekly counseling and cognitive behavorial therapy methods.  when the trembling and tremoring began, I went back to the counseling center to ask about them.  The psychiatrist had said some people react to Prozac in that fashion and that the side effects wane in time.  I also read that stimulating effects such as those were actually fairly common in Prozac users.  I go back to MY Psychiatrist in two days to discuss the effectiveness of the pill, the side effects I'm experiencing, and whether or not we should continue.

Excessive prolonged coughing spells, especially at night, occasional diarrhea, isolated, patchy skin rashes on torso and extremities and itchy scalp all noticed within a week of starting this drug and has been persistent since.	My doctor prescribed this medication as a prophylactic measure, since I have had Type I diabetes for the last 33 years. Recent tests have shown traces of protien in my urine possibly indicating early signs of renal failure.
1381	biaxin	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	inner ear infection	There weren't any.  I had to stop taking this medicine after 4 days due to the side effects.	Severe stomach cramping along with frequent visits to the bathroom.  I have had this experience with every type of this medicine: Z-Pack (zithromycin), arithromycin, and now the clarithroymcin.  My doctor said the side effects with the clarithromycin are much less compared to the other types and I found this to be false.  With all the above mentioned medicines, I've always started to get stomach problems on the fourth day.	I stopped taking the medicine after side effects appeared.

Will likely be on Prevacid indefinitely due to GERD unless I have Nissen fundoplication surgery, and perhaps even still then.

I now only have a flat day once every few weeks.	sleepiness but as time goes by your body adjusts to it. Compared to mood stabilizers and anti psychotic drugs citalopram is a dream drug. You do not gain weight! I have taken most of the usual bi polar meds and felt like a fat zombie. 80mg of cialopram really works.	Started at 20mg and slowly went up. I did trial many anti psychotics with it. Although the other meds worked the side effects were revolting. So I have just stuck with citalopram 80mg. There is a huge huge difference from 40mg to 80mg. I became a lot less manic at 80mg infact i am basically never manic at 80mg. Really this dose levels me out and i recommend it for anyone who suffers rapid cycling bi polar. I have been on 80mg for over 18 months and the change is amazing!

With my first baby, I got pregnant immediately, within only a month of trying and now, I can't get pregnant.

1251	catapres	8	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	"Catapres was initially effective at reducing my blood pressure on it's own, but there was reduced effectiveness over time. For this reason I began taking Betaloc in addition to catapres (daily). Taking these two drugs together has resulted in good blood pressure control with a fairly low dose of each drug.

A side benefit of taking catapres has been that it helps to control my Rosacea symptoms. I have had the reason for this explained to me, but cannot recal the details (has something to do with Catapres effect on the sympathetic nervous system)."	I experience slight sedation after taking Catapres which is helpful for me as a light sleeper. I believe I experience some slight lethargy that is ongoing, but not troublesome. When I first started taking Catapres I got a very dry mouth, but this quickly went away. I have experienced no other side effects that I am aware of.

A fourth of the pill still helped me sleep but, the wild dreams stopped.	"Before taking this medication I was in constant pain. Every muscle in my body hurt. Legs, Back, arms. All my joints felt like they were being nawed away and had burning pain in ever muscle. I had a Migraine ever minute of every day. I was constantly exsausted. After taking it for one week, I felt like a new person. For me this was a miracle drug. I stopped taking it after a month and was pain free.  
Since then, When ever my Fibromyalgia flares up... I take it for a week or more and it puts me back on a deep sleep pattern. I don't have to take it all the time. Just when I need it."
2103	renova	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Once the side effects wore off, I was left with much smoother skin, and less acne.

2827	wellbutrin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I started with a 150 mg dose and that did next to nothing. I recently increased to 300 mg and then I really started to feel better. I felt kind of hyper and for the first time in ages was able to go back to my gym routine. I noticed a decrease in appetite which in my case is great as I have about 20 lbs to lose. This drug definitely helped with my feelings of worthlessness and failure and with the crying spells.	The worst side effect for me is stomach upset and trips to the bathroom, especially in the morning after I've taken it. The feeling of being all cranked up is good when I have so much to do (others say this wears off) but it also makes me feel a bit anxious and unable to relax. I had mild sleep problems, mainly early waking.	I'm really loving the increase in energy and the lifting of the black cloud, but sometimes I feel a little spinny. Since increasing the doseage I've noticed I've been doing more stupid things than normal, like almost backing up into a truck that I knew was there!!??
3410	aricept	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	memory	I believe I noticed some improvement in retaining information from conversations as well as from reading,including,but not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers. I also think I was clearer with regard to remembering events -the event itself, as well as the order in which things occurred in the particular event.	Initially, I noticed no side effects. However, after taking it for approximately three weeks I began with nausea. I assumed I had caught a 'bug' & continued taking the med. Going into the fourth week the nausea became more pronounced & came intermittently throughout the day & evening. Additionally,the nausea was intermittently accompanied by a mild headache.	My doctor prescribed Aricept to aid my memory difficulties following a serious car accident in which I sustained multiple injuries, including a head injury. I do not recall events correctly, nor do I recall them in proper sequence. I have great difficulty remembering things;ex: If I have something on the stove I must stay with it; if I walk away I become distracted & completely forget I have something on the stove; I forget where I put things;if I am given instructions on something, they must be written down, as I cannot recall them or recall them correctly. Some past events are forgotten or foggy.

2690	prinivil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	Blood pressure numbers decreased significantly. Had headaches in the past, most likely due to high blood pressure - no longer having any problems with headaches.	I didn't experience any noticable side effects.	I take one pill per day and have been for the past five years. I am now following a new eating and exercise plan and have lost weight, so I may not have to continue with this medicine in the future.
2208	advair-diskus	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	Much greater ability to breathe.	I didn't observe any significant side effects aside from a little bit of dry mouth which is alleviated by drinking some water.	I took this for maintenance to prevent asthma exacerbations.

Had tried Zoloft after my previous pregnancy, which seemed to stop working. Cycled through a number of other drugs (8 within 9 months) and ended up sticking with EffexorXR as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially.	"Weight gain, difficulty losing weight, blurry vision, general 'blah' moods. 
Attempted to taper off & managed to only go from 225 to 150mg for a week before MAJOR side effects kicked in: headaches, brain 'zaps', aggression, agitation, extreme mood swings and hives.

1600	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Xanax for me is particualy beneficial when either I need fast relief (one of the fastest acting benzodiazepines) or more in a social setting because it gives a more stimulating relaxation (i.e relaxes you but also enables you to be social compared to alternatives.)	The only thing to be aware of with this drug is that it is very short acting so while it may be perfect for situational anxiety (e.g a speech, social event, dentist etc) its not a good idea for people with more generalised anxiety as its short acting nature may mean that people get rebound anxiety and then feel the need to dose again (can lead to dependance.)	When taking as needed for particular events it works perfectly as a treatment
3187	desyrel	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia, headaches	On the 3rd day, I was extremely elated and more uninhibited than usual; headache was still present, but seemed unimportant. In addition, I slept through the night with the first two 50 mg pills.	My headaches worsened and I had additonal muscles aches. On 50 mg the first few days, I awoke with horrible facial and jaw pain; I also had some congestion. After going down to 25mg, the facial pain ceased, but I began having nightmares and after the day of elation, I was depressed the day following. I am currently wondering whether these effects will subside and the benefits increase.	Doctor started me on one pill for 3 days,then double for the next and 3 pills upt 150 mg. on the 7th day. I am still at 25 mg. due to side effects above.

Two brain chemicals in particular�dopamine and norepinephrine�are believed to play an important role in the ability to focus and pay attention to tasks.	Sometimes, I find I'm a little more tired when I miss a day.	I was diagnosed with Attention Deficient Disorder 13 years ago, a year after it was discovered that my daughter, then six, had the disorder. Prior to beginning a medication regiment to treat my disorder, I had tendencies toward impulsiveness, and difficulty staying on task, which affected many areas of my life. I have been able to achieve career and personal success that I know would not have been possible prior to taking the medication.

Gradual relief from severe TMJ and tension that began to feel like being frozen solid. Relief from restless leg syndrome. Ability to relax gradually over time. Relief from chattering teeth.	none really.	For years, after some kind of nerve damage after a spinal tap, I would start to have small seizures every time I would begin to relax. (GETTING TENSE DIDN'T HELP EITHER ;-) I had trouble laying quietly, let alone sleeping. My teeth chattered and my legs twitched like crazy and there was a very painful weak spot in my lower back. I still have the painful weak spot and pretty severe migraines, but this drug was a quality of life saver. When I took it at the same time as Topomax it was ESPECIALLY effective. I take 2 mg at night before bed, and sometimes another .5 or 1 mg during the day if symptoms were bad. It's exhausting to never be able to relax.

930	mevacor	2	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	originally brain lesions then lower cholesterol	I believe the treatment at the lower 10 mg dose was effective in reducing the serverity of my brain lesions. I also believe I was thinking more clearly afterwards than I was prior to starting on lovastatin. A brain MRI taken a year after starting on Lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous MRI had been lost when I changed doctors.	After increasing the dosage to 20 mgs to also reduce my cholesterol levels, I started to experience extreme pain in my arm muscles.	"""Lowered cholesterol about 65% as well as Lipitor. Had eventual adverse effects after 1.5 years of use. Caused extreme joint and muscle tendon pain in the fingers, hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, thighs and knees.

Was very tired, had memory problems, weight gain.  Had trouble moving around, joint pain.	Synthroid was prescribed as thyroid replacment hormone after total Thyroidectomy due to nodules, etc from Graves disease.  Was determined that 75 mcg was the correct dose.

2184	clonazepam	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	blepharospasm	Very slight reduction in muscle spasms around eyes.  Ended up also getting light Botox injections in eyelid muscles.  This combo therapy has not resulted in a total cessation of eyelid spasms, but has reduced them enough so that I can drive again (the main disability caused by the blepharospasm).  Taking the clonazepam at night also helps me get a better night's rest than before I took it.	The first few days I took it I was dizzy and very sleepy.  However, those side effects have now subsided.

3132	duragesic	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis joint pain, fibromyalgia	Relief from hip and shoulder pain, tingling painful feet in the mornings when I would first walk around. I also received relief from lower back pain and as such allowed for better sleep to occur. There is also comfort in knowing that as my illness progresses and as I age that relief is out there for me when and if I choose to use it again.	Soemtimes the skin where the patch was placed became sore, itchy, red and inflamed. However, the most problematic side effect was during the transition phase between each 30 day prescription. For example, if the pharmacy did not have the product, I would have to go without a patch for a day or two I would experience withdrawal symptoms, jitteriness, crawling skin, sleeplessness with dizziness. The whole ordeal of getting in to see the doctor every 28 days, getting the prescription,, well, it all was getting so stessful I just went cold turkey and quit using them. Which, by the way, was pretty foolish because I had a difficult three days by myself to say the least.	I was having considerable hip and shoulder pain.  Also, I had significant sciatic pain but the sciatica pain was not as chronic as the shoulder pain.  While using the fentanyl patch I was given facet block injections and as a result have had little problem with the sciatica.  The fentanyl patch also relieved tingling pins and nnedle like pain in my feet that I had in the mornings when I first woke up and put even a little of my weight down on my feet.  For me the patches served me for the time that I was using them.  I am however, glad that for now I do not currently use them.

In my forties, I had a recurrence of asthma.  The pharmacist and my doctor both said NOT to use the over-the-counter inhalers.  I did try one, and it was MUCH more heart-poundingly stimulating than albuterol.  Dangerous for someone with heart problems, but difficulty breathing would be dangerous as well.

At some point, I got a generic albuterol inhaler and found it much less effective than the Ventolin brand.  My doctor said that other patients had told her the same thing.

I rarely need it now, maybe only once every two years.  But I try to keep one with me at all times because when I need it, I really need it.  I take long walks down and up a hill and if I had an attack at the bottom of the hill I would be in trouble.

It is almost magic, though--one minute it takes a great exertion to breathe and I feel like I am suffocating--then I inhale Ventolin and my bronchial tubes open right up.  It is a lifesaver.

As a child and teenager I did not mind the slight ""rush,""  I even liked it.  Part of that rush may be caused by the deep exhalation and inhalation required to properly ingest the drug."

If stretching of the muscles is done while on the medicine, the pain and tension are greatly reduced for longer than the 4-6 hours. If the medicine is taken before bed, morning pain and tension are reduced about 50%.	Drowsiness (moreso when already tired). If the medicine is taken after 8-10 hours of sleep the drowsiness is manageable. If the medicine is taken after not much sleep, the drowsiness interferes with functioning.

1360	crestor	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol		Over a period of several months, I got to a point where I ached so much in the morning that I could hardly get out of bed, I could control the pain with OTC painkillers. I had been able to carry a 40 pound bag of dog food easily, I got so that I could barely carry five pounds of groceries. I felt that I had aged about twenty years in a few months!	"I lucked out finding the answer in an online newsletter that warned Crestor users of this problem which the manufacturer claimed was ""very rare"". My doctor told me to stop it immediately, gradually I got better. I still cringe when I see Crestor advertised on TV or in a magazine..."
321	ativan	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	it makes me not nervous and i think it helps with depression also	tired and now totally can't get off of it. sometimes i have a tremor in my head moving and i wonder if it's because of the drug. also when you are on it for a long period of time lets say 2 or 3 years then your body gets used to it so now it's doing nothing and you need to double the dose. thats when it gets bad	take 1 mg 5 times a day
1425	adipex-p	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	diet	"The drug after an about an hour went into affect.  I had more energy and felt the desire to ""do things.""  During the day I did not think about food, and had no desire to eat.  I felt good and didn't care about eating.  It left you with a feeling of being happier too."	"It immediately ""woke"" you up.  I had a hard time, going straight to sleep at night.  I generally stayed awake about 2 hours later than I normally did.  But in the morning I wasn't overly tired, and as soon as I took the next pill within 30 minutes I had no desire to go back to sleep.  Also sometimes I would have a funny taste in my mouth."	Well their wasn't much treatment details.  You take the pill first thing in the morning and drink a glass of water with it.  It is an appetite suppressant.   It also gave me more energy as well, giving me more incentive to exercise, work around my house, etc....
225	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	"This drug definately does have an effect on depression.  I went on a trip and while I had enough for the duration of the trip, I ran out the day I returned and was unable to get the refill for several days.  I noticed a significant change in my mood and affect and began experiencing symptoms of depression again.  Although I tried to keep a ""stiff upper lip"" my husband noticed the change."	"At the beginning of treatment I noticed a slightly elevated heart rate and I felt a bit jittery.  However, I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression."	"Overall, I feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects (which I know can occur with some antidepressants).  My libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before I began taking this drug.  I know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  My husband and I both smoke and I do smoke less when he is not home.  He is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if I want to go outside with him and smoke.  Usually (not always) I say yes for the companionship but sometimes I decline.  When he is not home I will smoke approximately 4 cigarettes in an 8-9 hour period (I used to be a pack-a-day smoker).  
Overall, I feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  I began taking it after my father died.  He battled cancer for 3 years and I took care of him the entire time.  His loss was debilitating to me.  No pill is going to change what I went through or how I feel, but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without ""coming unglued"".  My doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from Ortho-Tricyclen (which I was highly loyal to) to Loestrin Fe 24.  I must say that between these two drugs, physically I feel ten years younger (I am 33 but I feel 23 again).  Overall I would rate this drug as successful for me and will continue on it as long as my doctor and I feel is appropriate for me."
3915	nexium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Had absolutely no problem with acid reflux while taking Nexium.	None to speak of. It is recommended to take this drug for only 4-8 weeks but I took it for 3 years with no problems.	"1 dose per day completely eliminated acid reflux.

2924	tramadol	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	rib pain and muscle inflammation	I had inflammation in my ribs due to severe coughing from bronchitis.  Doc told me to only take tramadol in cases where the pain was severe and not to mix with my muscle relaxer (flexeril).  Tramadol did do a decent job of taking away the pain and helping me sleep.	I took tramadol once, that's all it took for me to decide I didn't want to take it again.  I took it in the evening and went to sleep a few hours later, it made me very sleepy.  Upon waking up in the morning I felt extremely nauseous, shaky and - it's hard to explain, I felt inside my head a lot.  Very cloudy headed.  I thought I'd feel better if I took a shower but ended up throwing up b/c I just couldn't stand up, all I wanted to do was lie down.  I felt very dizzy. I laid down for about 10 mins and felt a little better, stomach was still upset though.  I ate something and immediately felt nauseous, was shaking uncontrollably and sweating.  I threw up again.  The episodes continued through most of the day.  But I felt better as time went on.  I decided the side effects just aren't worth it!	Overall Tramadol just isn't work the side effects I experienced.  I'd rather take a few Aleve and deal with the left over pain.
2128	renova	6	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles	The treatment benefits for Renova are more skin clarity.  Also, i believe the freckles on ;my face are fading quite a bit.  The fine lines did not really get any better. My skin is not really that different to notice real changes	more sensitive skin when getting facials and wax treatement.  The skin became very thin and from now on I have to do eyebrow threading instead of wax.  Also, you have to be very careful in the sun.  I use sunscreen so I haven't had any issues with too much sun.	rum a quarter size amount to face every eveining
1369	biaxin	7	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	strep throat	It worked quickly--within two days my sore throat began to feel better and the night sweats disappeared.	Dry mouth, yeast infection	The drug did not fully get rid of strep throat. After the 10 day supply was exhausted, strep throat reappeared and was treated successfully with levaquin for 14 days.
651	seasonique	4	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine + birth control	I had been on Quasense (a generic for a different type of extended BC) and liked it a lot but I noticed when I would go off the pill (for period) I would get extreme migraines when my hormones fluctuated.  Switched to Seasonique since there are hormones in the last week of pills which my doctor thought might reduce headaches.  Nope.  After the first three months I had my period and had the same terrible migraines.  I gave it three more months but had the same results.  The good news?  Not pregnant.	"I experienced a number of side effects without even connecting it to the pill.  Once I read about all the side effects online it was an ""ah ha"" moment.  Weight gain --I am a runner and eat well and I have gained 10 pounds in six months.  I workout 5-6 times a week and didn't change my diet and couldn't figure it out.  I look forward to losing those extra lbs!  Acne --TERRIBLE acne.  I've never had a problem with my skin and my face exploded.  I had big cysts on my cheeks.  I also experienced night sweats.  I cannot recommend Seasonique."	One pill a day at the same time each day.
3374	lipitor	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesterol	Has successfully lowered and maintained patient's cholesterol levels for over nine years. Follow-up with 6 month bloodwork shows the liver to be stable - no evidents deleterious effects on the liver.	Leg and foot pain. When researched through forums and blogs, discovered that many experience moderate to severe leg pain with Lipitor. My husband could not recall when the leg and foot pains started and further research indicated that no-flush Niacin (500 mg, 2 x day) along with Policosanol (20 mg 1 x day) could be very effective in lowering cholesterol; therefore, Lipitor was stopped and for six months the laternative routine was started. A recent bloodwork indicated a 30% increase of cholesterol and my husband resumed taking Lipitor. By the way, his leg and foot pains did not diminish when he stopped taking Lipitor.	"Please note ""treatment side effects"""
495	meridia	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	Meridia helps me stick to my diet without thinking about food all of the time.  It seems that this happens in two ways; first, I do feel full most of the time, even though I feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  The other part is that I just don't seem to care as much about eating, feeling weak, full, ect.  This is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural, like a life style change.  I just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  Also, I have noticed that I when I am tempted to snack, I am able to see that I am usually emotionally stressed about something, so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.  It is not a miracle drug.  I still have to stick to my plan and focus on meal preparation.  Also, it took 1 and a half weeks to really start working in my system.  It did not help my hunger the first week.  Just give it some time to build up in your body!	At first I felt increased nervousness and anxiety.  After about ten days, it lifted my mood and began to take away my appetite.  Then the nervousness went away.  It is harder for me to fall asleep and to sleep as deeply as before, but some of this happens when ever I loose weight.	Take first thing in the morning with breakfast.  I eat three meals with two snacks a day and drink loads of water and iced tea.  You have to drink enough for this drug to work.  You need WAY more water, as much as possible.  then you really will feel full most of the time.

On the 75 MCG dose, which put me into Hyperthyroidism according to TSH numbers, I fell asleep in public twice.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I could not get up in the mornings, was tired all the time and had brain fog.  I think I could've slept 24/7.  Very frustrating.  Also had weight gain.	"""I had been on levothyroxine for about 6 years with no problems. I got a new doctor closer to my home &amp; he switched me to this drug, On it just 2 weeks I got severe anxiety attacks (hyperventilating). He has given me samples so I do not know if this will be covered by my insurance yet.  I got a blood test &amp; he said the levels were fine that I should see my internist for my anxiety.  NOT. I will go back on my regular meds for 2 weeks then try this again. I think it is this drug."""

Generally speaking I feel it has few benefits, however I feel it may have some way balanced my hormones... increased my sex drive I think but not sure.	diarrhea and some upset stomach	Blood sugar dropped by 50% with increase exercise and limiting high glycemic food intake. I felt that the metaformin is playing a minor role in this.
2000	vicodin	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	molar extraction	I felt no pain from the extraction on the Vicodin.	While taking Vicoden, I was very dizzy and sleepy. I was unable to drive or function at a normal level.	I was given a prescription for the first week with an option to refill. I did not refill because I was not in a lot of pain and didn't want to continue to experience the side effects.

I cant function normally, yes i can be out in society and safe as it takes away my urges, but i feel emotionally numb, i can't cry and at night my legs twitch untill i pass out.

I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.	None at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage.	Initial treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation

"The gca with eye involvement responded to the 60 mg prednisone immediately. the tapering of the prednisone proves to be the most difficult. After the first complete tapering ( down to zero ) a relapse occurred. Now on 6 mg maintencance. 
The side effects are somewhat held in check through rigorous vitamin and other orthomol. products, fishoil etc and exercise."
3077	minocycline	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	face cleared up conciderably. It took about 2 months for the drug to become conciderably effective though.	There were no side effects associated with the drug. The doctor mentioned it would make birth control ineffective but had no confirmation of that.	Face and body cleared up conciderably.  It did take a while for the drug to take effect - but was worth it in the end.  I am now pregnant and will continue treatments after I have the baby.  Once I stopped taking it before I got pregnant - my face began to break out again. So you really have to continue to take it to keep the benefits.

I took my first mobic and not an ibuprofen since. I&#039;ve been able to sleep, not be tied down by a clock for pain, and have more mobility than I&#039;ve known in months! I&#039;m grateful.

1495	metrogel	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rosacea	Metrogel 1% significantly improved the redness on my cheeks, nose and chin within 3 weeks of use and reduced breakouts of papules due to rosacea triggers.  It was easy to use with no drug interactions.	My dermatologist prescribed metrogel for rosacea. I experienced mild stinging from the metrogel. This is a very mild side effect and would not deter me from using this medication.  The results far outweighed the mild side effect.	My dermatologist prescribed clindamycin first for rosacea. I experienced moderate results from the clindamycin but not a significant improvement and still had significant breakouts from rosacea triggers. Metrogel rapidly reduced the overall redness of my skin and significantly reduced the breakouts in severity and duration.
3640	retin-a	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne and wrinkles	My skin is now smoother with less acne.  I still get a pimple here and there, but for the most part, my skin has been very clear.	My skin had slight burning the next day as well as a lot of flaking and dryness.  It is very difficult to control the dryness.  I put a lot of moisturizer on it in the morning, but need to reapply it throughout the day.	After wasing your face at night and letting it completely dry, you apply a thin layer all over your face and go to bed.  In the morning you need to wash your face and apply a lot of moisturizer.

I couldn't even keep my head up at work because I was so drowsy. I would have to go lay down in the break room. It got so bad I had to quit taking it.

Lamactil has made me very agressive and angry! I cry all the time and my doctor told me he wanted to up the lamactil, and I said, but dr. I didnt feel this way before. And he uped it anyway. I am not taking the new dosage bc I have a child who is possible schizophrenia but is too young for the diagnosis and two angry people is not a good mix.

2323	lexapro	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety and depression	After the first few DAYS my anxiety was greatly reduced. I felt less depressed and did not feel prone to panic attacks that I had been having prior to starting this medication. I was very pleased with the reduced anxiety and depression.	At first I had some mild nausea, which went away and then I didn't have any side effects. This medication did not make me gain weight and it did not lower my sex drive- both which were concerns for me.	The medication worked great, and I would have rated it a 10 except getting OFF the medication was difficult. For six-eight weeks I had what I've come to learn are called brain zaps... a strange sensation that is difficult to describe and not pleasant. Lucky for me I had read about this so it did not scare me... otherwise I would have been very concerned. I pretty much just rode it out for those 6-8 weeks and then it went away and I've been fine. If I had to do it over I would still have chosen to take the lexapro because is was so effective for my anxiey/depression which was off the charts when I started.

358	neurontin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Neurontin coupled with a stimulant such as caffeine gave me a warm sense of well being and evenness.  However, the drug acted merely as a Novocaine to numb my depression and did nothing to help correct my brain chemistry.  That said, it was an effective enough band-aid that I suffered the sexual side effects in order to take it as prescribed.	"Sexual side effects included inability to achieve a full erection (when summoned) and inability to orgasm/ejaculate.

Softening of the stool- this problem lessened when I switched from tablets to capsules.

Memory problems and difficulty speaking."	I was prescribed Neurontin for severe depression in 8/09.  As of 9/10, I am still taking it but considering ECT.
2320	lexapro	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means.	The side effects for me included slightly lowered sex drive but not completely gone and climax is still possible.  I am drowsier on this drug than I was before and have lost some of my motivation regarding goals and dreams.  However, it is worth it to also lose the insomnia and crying spells.	I have tried 20 mg per day in divided doses (10 mg a.m. and 10 mg before bed at night) as well as 15 mg per day administered once in the morning.  I prefer the 15 mg although the 20 does work a little better as long as I divide the doses.  I am staying at 15 because I would like to take as small a dose as possible while still managing my depression symptoms.  I was happier overall on 20 mg however.  Oddly enough, taking 20 mg once in the morning rather than divided into a.m. and p.m. seemed to make my depression worse and I found myself crying more.  All in all the best for me is 20 mg with half in the morning and half at night.  However, for long term use I prefer to take 15 mg just once per day at night.
830	zegerid	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	acid reflux	The drug reduced the frequency of acid reflux events and the associated pain	After a few days I experienced severe muscle ache in legs such that I had difficulty climbing stairs. I also had overwhelming fatigue and even indigestion	This drug was fairly effective after one week's use week but did not cure the reflux completely and the side effects were very debilitating. I experienced a rebound effect after stopping which lasted for approximately four weeks. After having an endoscopy I was diagnosed with gastritis.
4067	mobic	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	neck pain from car accident whiplash	Hard to judge whether or not it was actually reducing the inflammation.  I was taking it while undergoing physical therapy which seemed at times to exacerbate the pain from the whiplash.	Even though I took Mobic as directed with food and/or milk, it made me extremely nauseous, which was more debilitating to me than the whiplash pain I was experiencing.  I stopped taking it after 1 week and was immediately no longer experiencing nausea.	My dotor precribed this for treatment of whiplash follwing a car accident.I was doing physical therapy exercises twice a week and taking 1 Mobic pill, 2X daily with food.
2779	clindamycin	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	prophylaxis after oral surgery	I really don't know if there are any, since I'm taking it prophylactically.	For the first 2 or 3 days I was hungry all the time, I think I've gained weight.  I'm on day 5, and now I feel bloated and full, have a little heartburn, food doesn't taste right, and bad taste in mouth.  When I belch or pass gas it smells terrible.  I wouldn't call it diarrhea, but I'm going more often, and it's just weird.  I'll finish the drug, but I don't think I'd take it again.	Taking it to prevent infection after dental implant surgery.

3955	prilosec	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acid reflux	there were excellent benefits including the reduction of extereme burning sensation in the stomach, throat and mouth. Also a reduction in bloating of the stomack and cramps. i was also able to eat a more varied diet without the awful symptoms of burning and indigestion which normally accompany the acid reflux.	i have to say that i didn't really have any major side effects from this drug, ceratinly none that would out weigh the positives.i did experience constipation on a regular basis but i increased my fibre and fruit and vegatable intake to counteract this problem.i also did experience and increase in headaches, but they were very mild.	"Losec tablets contain a medicine called omeprazole.This belongs to a group of medicines called ""proton pump inhibitors"" They work by reducing the amount of acid that your stomach produces. If you suffer with acid reflux, this means that the stomach produces too much acid which can cause pain and burning and often travels up your throat causing damage to it."
1130	evista	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	osteoporosis	I couldn't stay on it long enought to know if there were any.	I soon started having blurred vision, then extreme dry eyes.  I know it sounds strange, but I couldn't focus at work or concentrate.  The worst of all, I started having strange pain in my knees and hips that, I had not felt before.  It was not my ususal pain.  I had foot cramps, couldn't sleep real well. I had extreme hot flashes each day, however, those were tolerable. I am only praying that this will all go away.  I really did want to try this, if it helps build bone, but iw wasn't worth it, to me.

3700	effexor-xr	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	None.	I was desperate to feel better, but after the first pill was swallowed, I felt physically and mentally awful. I had palpitations, nausea, uncontrolable shaking, severe headache and felt strangely detatched from the world (it was as if I was watching the world through a dense fog).	"This was my Psychiatrist and GP`s last hope of treating my depression with medication, and I was told that I probably would suffer no adverse effects (""very rare"", apparently). However, after telling them at my appointment a month after starting Effexor XR, I was told that dissociative symptoms of PTSD are rarely made worse by effexor."
1511	kenalog	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I saw a moderate decrease of inflammation in some cystic acne lesions.  In the case of mild acne that is not cystic, the risks outweigh the benefits if the injection is not done properly.	I developed a prominent indentation on my face at one injection site.  This was caused by lipothrophy, or a shrinkage of the fat cells beneath my skin.  This usually resolves within 2-4 weeks.  Sometimes it never goes away completely.  I have also been unusually irritable and anxious.	A dermatological assistant injected what she assumed to be several adult acne cysts on my face with an unknown amount of Kenalog 10.  About a week after one injection site developed an indentation the size of a pencil eraser. On a subsequent follow up visit the doctor told me that this would go away in two to four weeks.  In two weeks, I have seen no improvement.  I feel that the docor did not adequately explain the possible physical and emotional side effects of this very potent drug.  She never said that it was a steroid.

to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil

physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When

2001	vicodin	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	i got my toothpulled	I took the drug shortly after having my tooth pulled.  I never noticed a great amount of pain, and contribute this to the laughing gas and novicane during the proceduce, and taking the vicadin shortly after the procedure. I took the vicadin drug twice because after several hours I started to feel pain again.  It was effective in reliefing my pain.	After taking the drug, I became sick to my stomach.  I threw up everything that I had consumed prior to the procedure.  This feeling stayed with me for several hours.  I initally thought I was sick, because I did not eat when I took the first dosage.  I then took another dose, but this time I made myself eat a little something, (I could not eat much at this point), but it mattered not...I got sick again.  I threw the rest of the presciption out.	The prescription was given to me prior to having my tooth pulled.  I never filled the prescription because I really did not notice any pain.  After the procedure, I immediately went to have the prescription filled.  I took the medication while I was still numb from the novicane.  As the novicane wore off, and the two tablets I took wore off, I took the vicadine once again.

3141	ortho-novum	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	The only treatmenet benefits were the prevention of pregnancy and the near elimination of a monthly menstrual cycle --including the elimination of painful cramping during the monthly cyle.  The benefits at the time I was taking this medication outweighed the risks/side effects, but now the risks/side effects outweigh the benefits.	The main side effect was moodiness/mood swings.  I did not notice this so much while taking the medication.  I noticed the moodiness/mood swings more after being off of the medication for an extended period of time.  After being off of the medication I noticed a more stabe, hightened mood.	The treatment continued off and on for approximately 10 years.  During this time, I did go off of the medication for short intervals just due to the lack of necessity for the drug.  The medication was taken on a daily basis, and was effective.  Now, however, for me--the health risks involved in taking the drug (risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots) far outweigh the benefits (I am a non smoker).  In addition, the mood factor also played a part in not returning to taking this drug.

I tried on numerous occasions to stop smoking but was unable to remain smoke free.  I read about Chantix in a magazine and set an appointment with my doctor to see about getting a perscription.  I began my therapy, set a quit date for one week later.  I followed the instructions and noticed at approximately day three, that my cravings had eased somewhat.  In the days that followed, the payoff I usually recieved from the nicotine no longer had the same effect.  This was somewhat annoying to me, however I continued with the medication until I finally quit smoking.  I have been smoke free for over 6 months off the medication.  Chantix is one of the most effective medications I have ever used.  It really worked for me.

A combination of other drugs was tried, and they had a limited ability to control the nausea. I had lost a lot of weight, and was at the point where the weight loss had left me pale and weak. When Zofran was added to the list of drugs I was given, I had immediate relief and was able to stop taking several of the other drugs.  I now take Zofran in the morning and evening and have stopped an unwanted weight loss and can enjoy eating again.   I recently had a biopsy where I had to have nothing in my stomach for twelve hours.  The prescribed pain killers after the procedure immediately brought back the vomiting, and my friend reminded the nurse that I usually used Zofran for that.  Within ten minutes after giving me a dose the nausea was gone and I was able to get much needed rest.

The edginess, nervousness, impatience, fear of socializing and going out of the house, completely disappeared after one month of taking it. My close friends even commented that 'I was my old self again'. I was much more relaxed and happy. It made me realize that I was misdiagnosed as depressed, when what I really have is anxiety. After talking to my new psiquiatrist, we came to that conclusion.	COMPLETE loss of libido. That's why I discontinued the treatment.	I started with 10mg/day, for one month, when I started to feel less anxious, but not motivated or more energetic, as expected from an anti-depressive medication. Then the dose went up to 20mg/day for another 3- 4 months, when no 'anti-depression' effects were noticed, the dose went up to 30 mg/day, it made no difference either. I have stopped taking it gradually (20mg/day for 1 week, then 10mg/day for 3 weeks) until i stopped completely. Now I'm waiting to see how I feel, to see if I 'll try another medication, since the side effect described above was intolerable to me.

"""I have used Carac for 4 weeks. After the 1st week I began seeing flakiness, redness, burning and itching.  Taking a warn shower was painful, being in a car with the heat on was painful.  But I&#039;ve gotten through it.  Layers and layers of skin have peeled off.  Underneath my skin is as soft as a baby&#039;s bottom and clear.  Compared to having these lesions continually burned off, this short term uncomfortable condition was a better method."""
3627	retin-a	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult acne	After weeks of use, I did see a considerable decrease in pimples on my face.  Being in my 40's, I saw a benefit in my skin tone also.	The cream is very drying, despite putting a moisturizer on after it.  In the winter, I sometimes cannot use it on a daily basis since my skin will peel.  In addition, I have to make sure the cream goes no where near my eye area, since my eyes will tear the next day if the cream gets within 1 inch from my eye.  The cream makes a person more sun sensitive also; however, I always wear a 45 sunscreen.  I cannot use on my neck since I got a rash every time I tried.  The side effects are far less than any of the oral medications my dermatologist tried with me.	After washing my face and allowing it to dry, I apply the Retin-A in small amounts over my cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead.  I use it every night, except when my skin is peeling too much from use.  Then I either switch to every other night, or put a moisturizer on first (incidentally, my dermatologist said the Retin-A should be put on first, under the moisturizer).  I rarely ever get pimples in the areas I use the product.  Even though there are some side effects, the benefits outweigh that.

1473	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	nerve damage from brachial plexitus	significant decrease to nerve pain to arm	constipation	I have a history of a brachial plexus injury 8 years ago that has led to progressive increase in nerve pain to my right arm to the point I could no longer lift my camera and was in constant pain throughout the day. It was interfering with work and sleep. In the past, I was treated with short term steroids that masked pain and allowed me to participate in physical therapy. Results were always minimal, but better than nothing. After trying one medication for fibromyalgia unsuccessfully, my doctor agreed to try me on Cymbalta. It took about a month, but the results have been terrific.
3491	serzone	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	Lessened depression	It made me groggy during the day & made me sleep the sleep of the dead at night (not such a bad side effect).  I also had dry mouth & it sometimes caused mild nausea on an empty stomach.	I took this med after trying others for depression.  It worked pretty well.  I decided to taper my dose down when I got pregnant & was off completely when my son was about one month old.  Since then, I have kept my depression under control effectively through diet & exercise.
631	nortriptyline	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe depression	Mood lifted considerably. Able to live life again. Life is much lighter. I am no longer oversensitive, things like life's little injustices don't hurt so much anymore. My daily experiences in this initial period can be followed on: http://nortriptyline.blogspot.com/ where I am keeping a diary. This is for the benefit of others who are indecisive and want to know more details before embarking on a course of medication themselves with nortriptyline.	So far all the side effects seem temporary. Cold hands/feet, white face. Bad taste in mouth. Fuzzy in the beginning. Nothing serious so far.	So far the treatment is only to take one tablet a day, and occasionally an Oxazepam in the first two weeks, if I am afraid of falling back into a depression. I started taking both for the first three days, but will soon leave off the Oxazepam. We'll see what happens, it can be followed on my above-mentioned blog. In any case so far I am happy I am taking this medication, I feel much better. I was severely depressed when I started taking it, but the depression seems quite suppressed now.

3664	effexor-xr	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Effexor was very effective at alleviating my symptoms of depression.  My mood improved dramatically, I felt happy and engaged in life again.  It also worked fairly quickly.  I began feeling the effects within the first week.	The side effects I experienced while taking Effexor were insomnia, rapid heartbeat and grinding my teeth at night.  Also, I found myself incessantly jiggling my leg while sitting at my desk, watching tv, etc..  All in all, these were minor and as easy trade-off.  The major side effect I noticed was a complete loss of libido and inability to reach orgasm.  Simply put, it was as if a switch had been turned off on my sex drive.  This side effect was the reason I chose to stop taking Effexor.	"My physician started me out on 37.5mg/day for 1 week then increased the dosage to 75mg/day for another week and, finally, to 150mg/day.  After taking 150mg/day for about a week, I felt it was too much...my heart was always racing, I couldn't sleep, and I generally just felt ""nervous"".  My physician dropped my dosage back to 75mg/day and that seemed to work best for me.  I absolutely feel that the Effexor helped lift my depression.  However, I eventually chose to stop taking it because of the sexual side effects.  After being on Effexor for about a year, I both wanted and needed to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband again.  I dropped the dosage back to 37.5mg/day for a week, then one every other day for about another week before stopping altogether.  I don't recall having any ""withdrawal"" symptoms.  Within a few days of the last dose, all sexual functions were back."

After 8 weeks my skin began to tolerate the cream a little better but it continued to itch and burn even after one year of use. I never used more then a pea size per the insturctions but the itching, dryness and rash never went away. It was very difficult to wear an type of makeup that didnt irritate my skin, while using this product. I made the mistake of using this product under my eyes, i learned later that this cream is not intended for use under eyes and due to the drying affect of this product, it did make the fine llines under my eyes appear worse.

I did not see any improvement of the acne on my cheek, and in fact, suffered worse acne while using Tretinoin."

Initially I had a bit of nausea and extreme sleepiness the first week, but then that subsided and everything was great for a month. After that I began to experience itchy skin, but not enough to be bothered by it. Soon after that I then broke out in hives all over my body in the middle of the night several nights in a row. The itching was unbearable and I had to switch to a different medication.	I took one dose a couple hours before bed each night. I also have regular therapy, yoga practice, daily exercise and healthy diet.

1459	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic back pain/depression/anxiety	"Hello all !
Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription."	I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials, and then 10 refills. So my advice to any of you, is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. It takes 3-6 weeks for a Human to become physically and mentally dependant. I am very pleased overall otherwise.	1 pill (30mg) Per day, in the morning.

These side effects were so strong, my co-workers noticed and were concerned for me.  A week later, I took half a pill to ease my anxiety and help me sleep.  The side effects were less, but still noticeable by others the next day at work.  The last two times I tried ativan, I only took 1/4 of a pill.  It did still ease my anxiety and the side effects were mild, but I decided I'd rather live with the anxiety than live with a mind that felt slow and stupid.

The treatment consisted of injected 2 syringes, one on each side of the furrows lines on my forehead. The doctor said I could also have them injected on the sides of the eyes but i opted not to.

1045	vyvanse	6	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	adhd (attention deficit hyperactive disorder)	It really helps me focus better than my previous ADHD meds. (Concerta 25mg) I am a very spontaneous person (Sometimes maybe slightly annoying) I really had trouble concentrating in school and remembering what we learned. I was always forgetful, but now after taking it a few days, I nearly never forget anything. And I remember the material covered in class.	"Few side effects, BUT...the few that I did have were quite severe. The biggest and worst effect was the constant chewing, mostly without noticing. As I said before, I'm spontaneous. And my spontaneous self had decided to buy a pacifier shortly before my doctors appointment where I was prescribed Vyvanse. After taking the vyvanse,I felt the sudden urge to chew, on anything ane everything, including the pacifier, my fingers, my cell phone, and the worst, my cheeks. I could feel the pain of chewing my cheeks, and I could taste the blood, but I didn't know what caused it. I didn't know that I was chewing my cheeks at that point. By the end of that day, I had chewed both cheeks, my tongue, and the right side of my top lip quite badly. It also made me lose all intrest in eating, and I love to eat, and I need to eat. (85 lbs. 5'1"") after school, I knew that I had to eat, and spent over 30 minutes eating a single cookie."	"On 9/18/11 I was prescribed (30) 30mg Vyvanse for ADHD to take every morning. It had common side effects on me, such as loss of appetite, severe chewing, and I ""geeked out"" pretty bad. I'm not usually a very organised person, but shortly after school, I spent 5 hours cleaning. (My binder, my room, the house, etc.)"
4045	amoxil	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	tonsilitis	slight reduction but that is all, 2nd week always still there so yet again more pills but usually never completely gone. accupuncture far more effective, within a few weeks gone down, consider that lymph was size of a walnut so that is great news	none just not working	7 day course, then repeated as symptoms still remain, eventually after about 4 years of having this they refuse to give any more pills, they say nothing they can do however they checked for glandular fever and such but all clear, this has been ongoing always antibiotics i believe we already tried penicillin but with no joy there,
2791	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	the treatment benefits were an increase of energy and an overall increase in mood while not affecting the libido.  after 2yrs it stopped having the same affect.	no side affects from this med	took 2 75 mg bupropion and 300mg zoloft in the morning.
2507	delestrogen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause/hysterectomy	"Significantly reduced symptoms of menopause, including eliminated all hot flashes (as long as the drug is being taken), reduces skin dryness that occurred after hysterectomy, and preserved sex drive. 
preserve sex drive"	I am not aware of any side effects from this drug, I did not experience any.	Doctor told me I could take as little as 1/4 tablet per day if I wanted. I take one per day and I am very happy with the results. If I accidentally skip one day, I know fairly soon that I have missed it because I get chills or start to have hot flashes.
766	azopt	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	glaucoma	Although this is not available in generic, I am using the generic versions of alphagan and betagan in conjunction with this drug. Each drug was used independently to determine side effects before they were combined for treatment. (This was a many visit process! But the results have made it was worth it) This combination lowered my intraoccular pressure to the point that it was not necessary to have surgery - my next step since other combinations did not work.	Occasional burning when put into already irritated eyes.	In conjunction with the above mentioned drops, I have had consistently lowered pressure with no side effects.
417	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Improved my quality of life and was able to maintain a job for longer period of time. I have suffered with chronic severe migraines since the age of 4 with severe nausua resulting in 3 to 4 emergency room visits per month. I missed so much school, work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression. I still suffer today 44 years later with them but they are not as severe and I can now function in life somewhat normal. Imitrex gave me a chance to live my life the way I wanted to!	Usually a feel of tiredness 10 to 12 hours after initial dose which can last up to 24 hours. Taking one dose of the pill has less effects of tiredness then taking the 6mg shot or taking them both within a 24hr period.	After over the counter medications failed to relieve headache pain I could tell if the headache was triggering a migraine and at that time take the imitrex pill and the migraine would be totally gone within 30 minutes. If the migraine was to strong with nausea symptoms and the pill didn't work, I would then take a imitrex 6mg shot for almost instant relief including nausea. Very rarely will the imitrex not work and then I have to go to emergency room.
3602	retin-a	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	My acne has completely dminished...i have the occasional break-out, but on a an everyday consistent basis i am now acne-free due to Retin-A!  It helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it, however after a few weeks off, the effects are just as wondederful to your skin as when you first began.	Peeling, dryness, sun sensitivity	I applied a small amount of Retin-A every evening before bed and washed if off in the morning.  If you are able to get through the initial stage which includes the side effects  (peeling, dry skin, redness, irritation, and sun sensitivity) your skin will emerge better looking and healthier in the end.
1315	prevacid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Taken each morning 30 minutes before eating, keep me from having any acid reflux.  One daily dosage worked for the entire day.  Even into the evening, if I ate spicy food or chocolate, I could go to bed without experiencing any heart burn.	None that I have encountered.	I have been taking meds for my acid reflux for many years, originally Omeprazole (generic for Prilosec).  However, becaus Omeprazole was not on my insurance drug formulary, I was taking Prilosec OTC.  At my last check-up my doctor prescribed the Prevacid and I like it.  It even tastes like strawberries!
1330	prevacid	5	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	acid reflex	supposed to stop acid reflex, which it did for 2 days	congestion and pressure within 2 hours after taking the morning dose on the 3rd day.	I will be taking Omeprazole, as I have been doing for years.. took Prilosec before the generic was available.   Prevacid contains only 15 mg of acid reducer whereas the other two contain 20 mg.  Yet you are charging as much as the others, and giving the customer 25% less.
3891	dispermox	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	IT was to be for a sinus infection which was not able to be documented due to the immediate reaction to the drug. IT is normally prescribed for its antibiotic effect on the respiratory system.	About 1 hour after taking the first dose the side effects started.  There was severe tingling in the sinus cavity increasing pain and immeidate internal swelling of the sinuses.	There were none.
2278	lexapro	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	clinical depression	The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.	This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.	"This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone. It is just too unstable."
3762	spironolactone	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult moderate hormone related acne	my usually oily skin dried up considerably and as a result the frequency of spots reduced.	in the first week i experienced headaces, pulpitations,nausea,insomnia and halusinations,dry mouth and lips along with frequent urination. i almost stopped taking the drug but i gave it a little more time and eventually felt better..most side effects disappeared and i remained with dry mouth lips and sorish throat.drinking alot of water helped.	50mg tab once a day for 4 months
3900	dispermox	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ear infection	It cleared the ear infection completely.  It offered me assurance that the infection did not progress to brain.	I did not experience any side affects.  I take Amoxicillin because it agrees with me.	I always take probiotics while I am taking antibiotics.  I also take the amoxicillin with food and water every time.
3616	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	melasma, unevean skin tone, ocasionally pimples	The skin tone got better, more uniformness, got rid of part of melasma and freckles. Reducing oiliness and minimizing pore size. Getting rid of acnee spots very fast.	Sun sensitivity, sensitivity of the skin, dehydration, tightness - they disappear after several months of constant use.	2-3 times x week
395	relpax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	The medication helped to reduce the headache pain if not eliminate it completely.  I was getting a headache almost dailey. It was affecting my job and family life. My migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. Taking Relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it.	The side effects were mild compared to the pain. Around 30 minutes after taking the pill, I would feel a little tired and sleepy.  However the feeling would not be so severe that I could not work or continue daily tasks.  This side effect would pass in about 1-2 hours.	At the onset of the headache, I would take a pill.  Some of my headaches would start at night, around 3:00AM and I would lay in bed hoping the pain would go away.  WRONG decision.  I quickly learned to take the pill as soon as I felt ANY sign of a headache, no matter what time of day or night.  If you don't take the pill at the onset of a headache, the pill will not be effective in stopping the pain and you will have to ride the headache out.  That could take a day to several days before the pain subsides.  It is extremely important to take this pill at the onset of a headache.
2518	motrin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	menstrual cramping	The benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation, I won't experience any cramp at all.	Side effects are I occasionally experience heartburn and nausea after taking the medication if I do not take it with food. Also another downside of this medication is that if i take it when the cramping has started long and severe, it is less effective and it takes a lot longer for the medication to be effective, no matter how much i take.	Overall I'm very satisfied with the medication in it's efficacy and side effects profile. I only experience occasional side effects and in general the medication is very effective in treating and preventing menstrual cramping. However, the medication is best being taken before the cramping has started or immediately when the cramping starts because the longer you wait, the less effective the medication is, regardless the dose of the medication.
2543	cosopt	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high interoccular pressure	Cosopt reduced my occular pressure in both eyes by nearly one third which pleased my eye doctor. The treatment benefits are long term. Reducing occular pressure will prolong eyesight by preserving the optical nerves. Sorry not 50 words.	I suspect it caused increased hair loss (thining) which I became aware of after about two - two and a half years of using the medication. I had hair loss before ever starting medications but it seems like this medicine began increasing the problem. Cosopt burned initially on application and turned the eyes red which cleared up fairly quickly. I am not aware of any other side effect. I switched medications and further explanation is below. If I knew these drugs do cause hair loss it might affect its rating,... but then again it does save the eyes.	"""I was allergic to Dorzolamide which made my eye&#039;s itch and redden all around the eyelids, Dr. changed me to Cosopt that has no additives and the itching and redness left! I use them daily with no problem for Glaucoma :-)"""
2350	propecia	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	My hair loss was stopped and I eventually grew new hair at the hairline and where the hair had receded on the side. I do not know if it affected my crown.	I noticed a slightly lowered libido and possibly a more slowly growing beard. My libido seems to be back to normal.	I have to take 1mg/day to stop hair loss. I did not notice results until recently after having taken it for 6 months and I am hoping to notice even more once I have been on it for a year.
3507	atacand	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	The dizziness subsided, the auras appeared a lot more infrequently	tiredness	"""The only medication that controls my blood press all the time, even when in a stressful situation. Still have to take a diuretic. No hot flashes or ear draining."""
1008	darvocet-n	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain after surgery	The Darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half I began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and I needed more. After my two weeks were up on taking it, I gradually just didn't need it any more.	During treatment I would get very weepy and depressed any time I was awake.  Of course I slept for hours after I would take it.  Other than those two things there were no side effects.	I had surgery for endometriosis that left me in the hospital for over a week.  The doctor had to cut my stomach totally across the bottom to rid my body of the diseased tissue.  I'd been on morphine in the hospital, then came home taking the Darvocet for the next two weeks.
126	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold sores	This particular treatment effectively eliminated all visible symptoms of oral herpes.  In my case, the symptoms were increasingly worse.  I would have an outbreak every two months that would last 14-18 days.  Since treatment, I have not had one outbreak.  Two years and counting.	Fatigue, and possible water retention.  I, nor my doctor monitored water retention or weight gain, but I am fairly self-aware.  The doctor did mention possible fatigue and/or nausea.	"""I found out I had genital hsv 1 about a month ago. I have never seen a sore or bump of any kind down there, but experienced a burning that I compared to being cut, literally. The doctor found a lesion by the vaginal opening, that looked like little paper cuts apparently. Anyhow the 500 mg Valtrex 1&times; daily started helping after 2 weeks. The weird nerve-like sensations I was experiencing were all gone after 3 weeks. The only negative side effect is fatigue after I take the dose."""
2923	tramadol	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis	When I began taking Tramadol I had severe Arthritis pain and could not sleep more than 3 hours a night. Tramadol relieves the pain without making you feel drugged up. I had to take up to 6 tylenol or 4 ibuprofens and it still did not touch the pain.	There was mild drowsiness in the beginning or with taking the full allotted doses but no other adverse side effects.	I take 2-4 Trmadol daily for my arthritis pain. Always 1 before bed and one upon waking if I begibn to feel pain during the day I may take another. my blood levels are monitored every 6 months to make sure there is no liver damage from this and/or the Ibuprofen I take.
3210	benicar	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	The treatment benefits are to help lower blood pressure.  Blood pressure is being monitored by the physician and the patient.  So far, the benicar has shown to be as beneficial as the previous medicine patient has been on for the last seven years.  Since the pill is considerably larger than previous medicine I was on, I do have to chew the pill.	I have not noticed any side effects so far.  I have been taking the medicine about one month.  I plan to visit the doctor in eight weeks again at which time I am sure the doctor will check my blood for any changes that may have occurred.  But so far, nothing has been noticed.	I have been on blood pressure medication for about seven years now.  Each doctor that I went to has changed my medication several times.  My blood pressure has been lower since visiting a nephrologist.  Recently I went to a regular general practitioner and she changed my medicine once again to the Benicar.  It seems to be helping somewhat with very few, if any, sign effects.
4010	celexa	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	There were no benefits.  It did not solve the organic issues and created new problems.	Firstly, this medication made me drowsy, and I often took involuntary naps mid-afternoon. Secondly, I had carbohydrate cravings, and felt hungry all the time. Lastly, after a couple of weeks I became weepy, irrational and anxious.  I can't imagine how magnified these symptoms would have been on a higher dose.	"""Did nothing to help my depression. Made me feel suicidal and zombie like"""
3919	nexium	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	active chronic gastritis	20 percent reduction of ulcer wounds in 4 months medication. Initially it was prescribe for 6 weeks (Feb 2008) but had no effects with the ulcer. The endoscoopy procedure revealed that the wounds became bigger and more inflamed. The medication was continued for another 6 weeks till June 2008. Slight improvement after 12 weeks of medication- The doctor recommends 6 months medication till the next endoscopy (till Dec. 2008) with the expectation that the ulcers will heal.	mild to mederate stomach ache	the medication has to continue for another 6 months (till dec 2008)- healing of ulcer is not significant-
3375	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesteral	It lowered my cholesteral considerably.  My total cholesteral was over 300 and my LDLs were over 200, but after being on Lipitor for three months, my total cholesteral is now 186 and my LDL is 86, so I am in good shape.  In addition, I have experienced NO side effects whatsoever, so I am pleased.  The only drawback is that it does not come in generic form, so my co-pay is $40.00 per month.	I experienced NO side effects whatsoever.  I have been on many medications over the last 10 years and normally experience at least some small side effect, but have not with Lipitor.  I do get my liver function tested every few months, and so far it has been fine.  This is not a problem for me as the benefits outweigh any hassle of getting tested.	I take 10 mg of Lipitor daily and get a liver function test every three months.  So far, this has been fine, but I will need to be tested continually as long as I take Lipitor.  I don't mind this, as the benefit of having a healthy cholesteral level is more important to me than any hassle of getting tested.  If at some point my liver function appears to be unhealthy, I'm guessing my doctor will have to reevaluate my situation, but for now, it's fine.
428	imitrex	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	disapearance of migraine headache	vomiting	took 1 pill on onset of migraine.  I found I needed to take the pill at the very first inkling of a headache coming on.  If I waited until the migraine was full blown, a second pill would be needed at the appropriate time.  If caught early, one pill would make the migraine go away
371	lamotrigine	2	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression/anxiety	More mellow mood. Just taking Wellbutrin alone wasn't enough. I am a mild bipolar and needed something to balance out my moods. I have both depression and anxiety. And do not sleep well. That's why I was on Ambien, too.	RASH. ALL OVER TORSO. Burning, intense pain for days! Swollen tongue; couldn't eat. Lips puffed up twice their size. My doctor prescribed a 10-day series of steroids. The first night, I had to swallow eight steroid pills. The next morning, I had to wake up and swallow another six. Then another week of lessened doses. I have been removed from all of my drugs. Not fun. WARNING about lamotrigine: there is a slim chance of getting a horrific rash. I thought it was too slim for me, considering I'm very healthy. I was totally wrong.	"""I&#039;ve been taking lamictal for three years.  I never felt it worked in the first place, but the docs kept increasing the dose because it was not working.  After being on 200 mg for about 9 months, I&#039;ve decided that it was not worth taking a pill that does absolutely nothing for me.  I still get severely depressed.

2368	propecia	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss, receding hairline	First of all there are a TON of competitors like rogaine on these reviews bashing propecia, how can you only take it for 3 months and have side effects that have ruined your life, i find that highly unlikely. Second, propecia does work even for a receding hairline, if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline 99% of the time you won't. I have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about 10 seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about 6-7 months in so u gotta give it time.	not as bad as i was expecting, don't let some little drug mess with your mind man your bigger than that. if any i would say a lower libidio but i kind of like it because before propecia i was wanking off like 10 times a day and now its like once or every other day.	propecia is cool just do research, actually this shit is too expensive but if u care about your hair i would recommend it.

1588	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	tia's - anxiety	The medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. I used to have panic attacks at times before I began using this medicine. Now the panic attacks are few and far between. Although I do not like to drive while taking the medicine, if I must I can with no problems. In social situations I am much more myself and can relax and have fun. I have had 3 mini-strokes. Since I began treatment with Xanax I have not had a single episode.	I have had no side effects from the use of this medicine. When I first started the medication it would make me sleepy. After time this side effect past and I have no problems now.	Upon treatment I found that results were immediate.

Valium released the muscle seizures and allowed me slowly to   return to exercise. It's not used much now that there's Flexeril, but F. can lead to depression and doesn't as effectively release muscle tension (in my case).	some sluggishness in the early morning, and sometimes an overall sense of dehydration, but that can be countered with drinking lots of fluids.	I determined that the best solution was to take it before bed--i could sleep through the night with it, whereas without I often woke up and had to take more ibuprofen and still slept poorly.

588	acyclovir	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold sore below lip	A very bad and large cold sore started to slowly go away immediately when started.  I started it because my cold sore wasn't going away and getting way worse.  So I was prescribed 200mg 4x a day, for 10 days.  Which it immediately kept the cold sore from getting worse. I was give another same perscription and kept taking it, then my doctor wouldn't give me any more, even though it was showing improvement.  So, I found that I could order it online, and it directed me to take 1600 mg during outbreaks, so I did.  And it started healing, and now after almost a month it's almost gone.  This cold sore didn't break the surface, but was getting larger so this medication was a life saver.	Slight headache, in the scalp area and forhead, but very slight.	Instead of taking the whole 800 mg tablet, I took 400mg (half) then the other half about an hour or so later.  So, 1600 mg a day was very effective, and work miraculously.  I believe this will keep me from getting any cold sores, I'll drop down to 800mg daily once the cold sore is totally gone.

I had to have the curtains always drawn, couldn&#039;t watch TV or listen to music, and the room always felt like it was spinning. l noticed that when they administer the benadryl, it burns when given thru IV. I had competent nurses who administered it slowly to prevent intense burning. I also noticed after both were administered, I felt like I needed to move around, so my fingers and legs twitched a little, but not too much. It helped more than anything, and I&#039;m really happy it was there as an option."""

Our house became a much more peaceful place once he was better able to control his temper, which largely came from his frustration in knowing he was not doing as well as he could.	Initially, he experienced some sleepiness, but he adjusted to the medication and no longer has this problem.	"We were initially reluctant to treat an otherwise healthy boy for what some describe as ""boy"" behavior, but he was increasingly frustrated with his inability to get along with siblings and classmates.  However, seeing now how much it has helped him - without making him into a different person -- we're glad we did."

I was more motivated to get out of bed and was more outgoing and energetic on the job.	I was not affected by any side effects while taking Zoloft.  When I felt able to encounter my day without the antidepressant, I weaned myself off of the drug with a decreasing dosage and had no side effects.

While it did not stop the flu in its tracks I did not get seriously ill and my recovery time was quite short.  Somo of my friends also contracted Swine Flu and did not take Tamiflu.  Two of them became very ill and it was several weeks before they coudl go back to work.  Their general energy levevls were low for about 2 months.

I had regular blood tests to check liver function, but had no negative reactions of any type.	Fifteen years of dermatologists, peels, topicals, Accutane, and nothing had cleared my cystic acne and constant breakouts, though a few treatments lessened the severity. Flutamide 125mg b.i.d. took one month to take effect, and within 6 weeks completely cleared ongoing resistant acne that had lasted more than 20 years and was worsening in my late 30s. AFter one year, we tried weaning off the drug. The results lasted for about 5 months, before the acne gradually returned. Went back on flutamide, and a month later the acne had left. We are now trying to see if a lesser maintenance dose is possible.

In addition, appetite loss, dry mouth, and some stomach upset were also experienced.	"I was originally prescribed 1 tablet bid and discovered that for me, reducing the dosage to 1/2 tablet worked much better. I am about 5'4"" and weigh 140 lbs. I now use the medication only on an as needed basis rather than take it daily, which is not necessary as my energy levels vary quite a bit. It was also suggested that I try Flexoril (sp) to see if the cause for my fatigue was caused by pain or discomfort which kept me from getting adequate sleep. That was not effective unless I wanted to miss  a day from even more fatigue than usual."
1005	darvocet-n	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain	Treatment benefits were to address pain and discomfort.  It was perscribed to me after I was in the hospital instead of Vicaden (spelling?), as Vicaden does not suite me well.  The medication began working after about 45 minutes of taking it and (for me) lasted over 6 hours.	Treatment side effects for me were nausea and feeling unclear or 'loopy'. I found that if I took more than one pill within six hours, I became very nauseated.  In addition, I would not have been able to function properly or drive a car comfortably because of the side effects with my clarity.	The treatment was for pain and was taken by myself for a situation that could not have been allieviated by medical attention.  I had an ovarian cyst rupture.  My doctor and the ER told me there was really nothing for them to do other than wait for it to be reabsorbed.  So, pain medication was my last resort.  I took a few of these pills over two days to help alleviate my extreme pain.

82	ventolin-hfa	1	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	asthma		Increased difficulty breathing, strange taste.	I have a prescription for albuterol for sports related asthma. I usually get the Proair inhaler but the pharmacist insisted this was the same and gave it to me. The first day I had it, I went for a run. As usual, about 10 minutes in my chest begins to tighten and I cannot breath. I took a puff of the Ventolin HFA inhaler. No effect. I stopped running. I took another puff. No effect. Still cannot breath. I am now bent over with my hands on my knees struggling to intake air. I took several more puffs from the inhaler. No effect. I am now struggling to remain conscious, I am getting light headed and everything in my vision is pale. I begin to lay on my back, taking a few more puffs of the inhaler. No effect. My throat is now beginning to seize from the sheer force it takes to inhale tablespoon-sized breaths. I have a headache and hear a high pitched whining. I try several more puffs of my inhaler. No effect. I lay on the ground doing controlled breathing for several minutes. I tried a puff of Ventolin HFA here and there with no effect, so I gave it up. I'm laying wondering if this is my last day on Earth. About 15 minutes of pure agony later I catch my breath slightly. I now have an enormous headache and am dizzy. I get to my feet and start to walk toward my apartment (across the street). Along the way, my chest seizes up a couple more times, and a couple more times I use the inhaler. No effect. I now have to wait another month before I can afford a ProAir inhaler before I can even exercise again. I think Ventolin is for underdeveloped little kids who think they have asthma but actually don't. I have real asthma and this stuff almost killed me. The puff that comes out of it is nearly invisible, the puff from a Proair inhaler is actually noticeable and...a 'puff'--about 15x more comes from the Proair compared to the Ventolin. Even waking up in the morning, the slight tightness I have then, Ventolin does nothing for. My girlfriend doesn't understand why I wheeze before AND AFTER I use the Ventolin. Well, it's because it doesn't work for me--in fact, it almost killed me. Everything in this story is true, but I may have taken more puffs from the inhaler than I listed...any ?'s feel free to contact me: thecrookfromthebrook at yahoo.com. Thank you and take care.

The second time it was a 75mg shot that pretty much dulled a uterus spasm I was having - felt like someone was ripping my insides out.

3520	lunesta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I usually slept through the night and did not experience drowsiness the next day.	I had a bad taste in my mouth in the morning.  This was mildly irritating and much better than not sleeping.  It didn't put me off the meds.	The only problem I have with the medication is that it is expensive--about $5.oo per pil--and that it doesn't always work.  It doesn't always help with jet lag, for instance, and there are other times when I lose half the night anyway, usually in connection with PMDD. It works about 80% of the time.
1246	sotret	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I took isotretinoin for persistent adult acne.  My skin was not by any means awful, but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal.	First, let me say that I didn't experience the awful side effects that some do with isotretinoin use.  I did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  In fact, that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  But the dryness was not nearly as bad as I expected.  For example, my lips never cracked.  However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless, I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  Tazorac one percent, which I used to slather on nightly like lotion, now sets me on fire if I dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.  I know the literature claims there's no anti-aging efficacy if it isn't used daily, but I'm hoping for the best.	"I have to confess that I'm confused by this section.  There were no real ""details"" associated with my treatment aside from what I've alreay described."

None, or at least he never complained about any.	"""It seems to be helping pretty quick. An hour and half later I have the side effects of dry mouth and extreme tiredness."""
2497	remeron	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Remeron (mertazapine) was a god send for me. I had chronic insomnia with sleep deprivation for 12 years and tried to treat it with OTC drugs. It appeared one night, not slowly over time. I tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested Remeron. It took a few weeks to take effect but it has been 100% successful for about 17 years now. I used to take up to 45 mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to 15 mg. over the years. If I miss one dose I know it. Falling asleep is no problem. My problem is staying asleep for more than 2 or 3 hours night after night after night. . . Not fun.	No side effects. No hangover. No morning drowsiness.	"""I was suffering extreme anxiety, weight loss and insomnia due to a diagnosed medical condition.  I tried several sleep aids and SSRIs.  Nothing worked.  Because of the weight loss I was prescribed Remeron.  It was a Miracle for me!  I slept through the night for the first time in months, relieved anxiety and I started gaining weight.  Over time, my anxiety went away, but I stayed on because I loved having an appetite (I had no appetite for years).  I guess I stayed on too long.  After 6 years I decided I should get off.  I was dependent. I suffered flu like symptoms for weeks--nausea, exhaustion, gastrointestinal upset, feeling like low-grade fever.  I finally got rid of the nausea, but if I&#039;m off for 2 weeks, the gastrointestinal upset creeps in.  I now take 3.25mg 1X week."""

I break one in half to divide between morning and afternoon.  I see my doctor once every 3 months to discuss how it's working.  I started out on 5mg, 2x/day, but I developed a tolerance to it over time and went from 5 mg/2x day, to 10mg/2x day to 15mg 2x/day to 15mg 3/day.
4049	amoxil	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	infected site of oreal surgery	The infection that developed at the site of my oral surgery subsided and this allowed the wound to begin to heal.	None observed.	The oral surgeon prescribed amoxicillin as a preventaitive measure after surgery.  I opted not to take a breaod spectrum antibiotic when there was no infection present.  Within 4 days of surgery it was clear that I did have an infection and filled that prescription. I took 500 mg of amoxicillin 3 times daily and took probiotics at least two hours after each dose of antiobiotics to replace the body's good bacteria.  After a few days the infection cleared.  I finished the whole course as directed.

"""I have been taking the generic Tenormin (atenenol) for probably 32 years now.  25 mg.  I take it at night.

He took me off it and I was going on vacation the next day or so.  Worse vacation ever.  I thought I was dying.  My heart was pounding.  I thought I would die up in the mountains.  Got back on Atenol when I got back home.  Everything was normal.  If I accidently miss a day or so, I can tell the difference.

1095	effexor	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression and anxiety	I noticed an improvement in my thinking within 3 days.  I began to think more positive and objective.  I also began to sleep much better, to much for quite a while.  After a couple weeks, I was not nearly as depressed and it kept getting better.	Some constipation, little to no sex drive	I was prescribed Effexor XR for depression.  I initially began on a low dose to make sure I could tolerate it.  The first day, I noticed a decrease in anxiety as it made me a bit tired.  After a few days, I could tell I was thinking more clearly and did not have that 'doomed' feeling as severe.  I began doing more things and getting involved which helped even more.  After a couple weeks, my Dr. doubled the mg. and that is the current level I am now on.  I feel very good and only have set backs when things in my life are extremely stressful.

4009	celexa	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	I really did not see any benefit in taking the medication.

956	diovan	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	For over a period of several years my blood pressure has gone down and has stayed down. Follow up visits to the doctor have proven to be much better when blood pressure was checked. The doctor has recommended that I stay on this product and along with exercise should be highly effective.	The side effects of Diovan were so minimal I cannot detect them; however, I cannot take the Diovan HCT because it messes up my eletrolytes and I get leg and foot cramps. I try to follow dosage instructions which recommends that this pill be taken at night before going to bed, if possible.	The treatment with Diovan is very simple. One pill at night before going to bed.The reason for that is most people's blood pressure increases at night and many people die in their sleep at night because of high blood pressure. The problem I have is that the pills get stuck in my throat and I have to eat something like a grape or anything really that will help the pill go down.It does not seem to keep me awake at night which is good.
2176	zyrtec	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	atopic eczema	The drug was very effective in counteracting severe itching caused by atopic eczema. Zyrtec was more effective than other similar drugs (Zodac, Zaditen) which I took before for the same condition. It did not have the effect of treating the actual cause of the symptoms (eczema) but it was very effective in treating symptoms, which was what I expected (I took other topical drugs for the eczema which did not ease the itching sensation).	I felt slightly tired after taking Zyrtec. However, this was not severe and I always took it in the evening because the information leaflet did mention that the drug can have these side effects. I was also always slightly more tired in the following morning (about 8-9 hrs after taking the drug) than typically.	This is a non-prescription drug and I took it because I was experiencing severe itching caused by eczema. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I only took it about 4 times when the itching was very bad, and it did alleviate it. I always took 1 pill a day.
284	xyrem	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	After suffering with chronic insomnia for the majority of my adult life, and after all of the popular sleep meds failed, I found Xyrem and it has changed my life. I am now in control of when I go to sleep and when I wake. The depression (Beck Index: 28) vanished after 3 weeks of treatment (Beck Index: 5). Anxiety has also abated. Loss of fat, increase in muscle size and strength. Improved energy. Improved interaction with friends and family.	During the first 2 weeks there was stomach irritation, increased sweating at night, and diminished appetite.  All have abated now.	"I take 3.25g at bedtime, usually 10:30 PM.  This normally produces sleep until about 2:00 AM. I then take another 2.75g dose and sleep until 5:30 AM.  On average, I get 5.5 to 7 hours of sleep and it is the best sleep I have ever known.  I no longer stay awake for days on end and I never have to come home on my lunch break to nap.  

With the exception of the outrageous price, Xyrem is an amazing treatment for insomnia.  It is a shame that the media has turned such a wonderful treatment into an evil 'date rape drug'."

Unfortunately once the tablets finished the infection returned so needed a 2nd course. I&#039;m currently taking a low dose at evening to keep the infection at bay while the specialists do some tests.  I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn&#039;t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant.

My son had been having terrible problems with allergies.  The cause is still unknown.  Constant hives, itching and worst of all his lips & eyes would swell excessively to the point where he couldn't leave the house.

After taking amitriptyline I am able to go to sleep in an hour or so. As for the Copaxone who knows? I have had only one flare up since starting it.	The Detrol was horrible. My mouth was so dry my tongue  literally stuck to the roof of my mouth making it difficult to speak. The Copaxone causes lumps and itching at the injection site.	When Zyrtec alone didn't controll my allergies my doctor prescribed the Veramyst to try. This combination seems to be working, Zyrtec once a day and Veramyst twice daily.

Gabapentin 300mg is taken 3-4 times a day depending on the severity of pain. Tetracycline HCL 250mg is taken once a day. The Copaxone 200mg is injected once a day.

Apparently, this will be long-term treatment.  My doctor and I had several conversations over high blood pressure.

Taking prozac made me more sleepy and I could not get up to do everyday thing. I just kept sleeping or yawning.  I wanted my depresion to go away but it did the opposite. Instead of helping me keep me depresed I felted more depresed because I kept sleeping all the time. The medication Prozac with me did not help my depression but rather calm me to the extent that I did not want to do anything. Also I kept going to the bathroom constantly. It takes down my sexual mood and difficulty in getting aroused at all.  Ritalin cause my mouth to dry up and kept drinking water like a camel. Jittery effect and when the medication wear off you feel it like large thump.	Doctor suggested to take Prozac at night time and Ritalin twice a day. So far it has worked for me a patient suffering depression for more than 15 years and it has helped me the Ritalin. Cannot say about Prozac but I notice that I do not get anxiety attack with it.

The drug also made me feel overall less tired (I was previously feeling tired all the time). Consequently, my sleeping pattern normalized."	"Upon starting the drug, I felt a mild nausea (a gagging feeling), but only for the first week.

Missing the drug for consecutive days quickly (in ~40 hours) triggered a single withdrawal symptom: brain zaps. Each zap lasted about 0.5 seconds, and seemed to be triggered by ""mild sensory overloads"", e.g., entering a room with different lighting conditions. The zaps were not painful at all, just confusing and (initially) frightening. Upon resuming the drug, the zaps disappeared as quickly as they had appeared (~20 h)."	Treatment was initiated by a general practictioner for self-reported tiredness and panic attacks. The next appointment was in two weeks. Since there were no continuing side effects, and the drug seemed effective, we decided to continue it for at least 6 months. I have now been taking it for 3 months.

I had a hystirectomy a year before I was put on the hormones. I say an increase in wrinkles in that first year. I can not say that I have seen a slowing in the aging process but I am sleeping better and that of course will bennefit the skin.	I have not experienced any side effects to my knowledge. I feel as if an increase in the dose would maybe last longer as I seem to be waking at least once a night with a hot flash. I take it in the morning so maybe by the time I hit the sheets it is out of my system. I do not miss a day and always take it at the same time each morning.	As I stated I had a hystirectomy at 50 years old. I went over a year w/out any homone treatment and the hot flashes got so severe I was waking about 5 to 6 times a night. I was using over the counter sleep aids and did not like them. I got the doctor to prescribe the hormones and the benefits were almost immediate. I have been on the same dose for over a year now and feel I might benefit from an increased dose. I am 54 now and am looking not quite my age but the aging process is speeding up I feel.
3109	ortho-tri-cyclen	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	prevent pregnancy	Ortho Tri Cyclen effectively prevented pregnancy, cleared up acne, gave me regular periods, helped with iron deficiency due to blood loss	Thinning hair, bleeding gums, eventually the iron deficiency came back	I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen at age 20.  It gave me regular periods (they aren't really 'periods,' they are just a withdrawl from the hormones) and less cramping, lighter flow.  It got rid of my acne. I did not get pregnant in my 7.5 years of taking the drug.  I think that eventually the pill prevents you from absorbing nutrients because my iron deficiency came back. I am not sure if the nutrient absorption has anything to do with having bleeding gums more often, but I did have a lot of pain because of a dislodged clot when I got my wisdom teeth removed and the oral surgeon said that this happens more often to women who take birth control. I stopped taking the pill to find more natural ways of birth control, and because my hair was becoming thin and brittle. I also don't like the stories of the effect hormones are having on our environment (going into groundwater).

Using it for more than 3 days at a stretch caused excessive peeling, which was visible even under makeup. Redness and rawness was also present. A break of a few days was required before restarting the treatment.	Tazarotene cream was applied to the face at bedtime and washed off in the morning

2286	lexapro	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I felt more stable in my daily activities; more capable of handling stress; and better able to successfully complete my daily responsibilities of working nights, parenting three children and keeping a house running at an acceptable level.	While I was taking the medicine, I slept alot during the day.  It could have been a side effect of my depression; however, I felt it was from the Lexapro because it was more extreme in the beginning of my takning this medicine and subsided somewhat after the medicine had been in my system for a while.  No matter how much I slept, I never felt rested and could still sleep a full night also.  This could also be attributed to my working night shift; however, once I quit taking the Lexapro, the need to sleep so much during the day subsided.	I was prescribed 10mg initially and this was not enough so my dose was increased to 15mg.  I would occasionally take an additional 5 mg, totalling 20mg, but this was rare.  I eventually weaned myself off of the medicine.  My doctor said that it would be acceptable for me to do this myself as I felt ready; largely because my father had died and my mother had remarried and we both felt it was going to be a temporary need only.  I took Lexapro for approximately 6-8 months.
1558	methotrexate	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rhematory arthritis	This drug definitely helped control flares and joint stiffness. It also helped defeat the incredible amount of hives. Hives were completely controlled.	Unfortunately, there were many side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, occasional vomiting, extreme fatigue, foggy mind. Bruising at the injection site was also very common.	One injection every week.
2943	mirapex	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	Before I began taking the Mirapex, I was taking Clonapin which was very ineffective as I was constantly waking up in the middle of the night having to take more medication to get back to sleep. I had to get up and walk around until the medication took effect and I was exhausted all the time. On Mirapex,  I am able to sleep at night without being awakened by my restless legs which is a huge relief for me and my husband.	"I have what I call a window of opportunity to take Mirapex by 7PM or I will be very ""anxious"" and highly uncomfortable due to the restless legs jumping and distress. It causes me to go to sleep shortly after taking it, which makes going to a movie theater almost impossible in the evening as I will sleep through most of the movie if I've taken my medicine."	"""For nearly ten years I struggled with restless leg syndrome, a truly miserable and frustrating condition.  The only &#039;treatment&#039; I found to be effective was to get up and walk about.  However, between about midnight and 6:00 a.m. this becomes quite inconvenient.  Soaking in water as hot as I could stand worked only for a few seconds.  Relief from massages was also extremely temporary.  Initially I tried Requip, which seemed like it might be helping a teeny bit, but left much to be desired.  Later a neurologist switched me to Mirapex.  Following a &#039;breaking in&#039; period, at long last I found relief from this miserable condition.  As long as I take my daily doses, I have relief.  So far, so good."""

I couldn&#039;t do simple math, my depth perception was off, and my time perception was off as well.

Drug works for 4 or 5 hours then I wake up as usual in the middle of the night.	I take this in an attempt to stay asleep like the drug promises. I rarely have trouble falling asleep. With Ambien CR, I fall asleep very quickly but still wake up most nights after 4 or 5 hours of sleeping. Therefore, the time release formula does not seem to work with me.

Now after 6 yrs my husband has no symptoms other than occasional acid reflux when eating anything with tomato sauce.	There were no side effects other than if he discontinued the medication he would become ill and end up in the hospital. Acipkex supposedly at the beginning was just a healing drug to be taken for a limited time. The only side effect would be not taking the medicine as prescribed.	"""I was put on Aciphex after antibiotic/PPI treatment for H.pylori and it does really work.  It has been 1 year and I can feel the difference.

Though no other drugs were taken to address the infection, the prescribed drug did alleviated the pain until the condition improved. Eventually a root canal was performed and I received a second prescription.	The only noticeable side effect was that I became drowsy when taking the drug and  had to lay down throughout the day.  As I was unable to work under these conditions,  I did not have to perform usual task, therefore it is hard to measure what I would or would not have been able to do while taking the pain killer.

This is the first time that anything has made any difference.	When I first started on the maximum dose of 300 mg twice a day I did experience dizziness,mild muscle twitching, short term memory problems and constipation.  The dizziness and muscle twitching did ease off after about 6 weeks but I still have constipation and seem to have difficulty remembering certain things.	I started on 50 mg twice daily and I was got no reduction in pain, my doctor gradually increased the dose to 300mg twice daily. Once I was on the maximum dose, I started to experience some dizziness etc as outlined above.  However some of the  Side effects became less obvious after about 6 weeks on the maximum dose.  It was worth it because I was feeling a reduction in my pain levels for the first time in 19 years

Rest is a must while taking this medication.  Its better if you do not drive and perform intensive activities right after taking this medication.  It is a very strong medication and since I have a petite physique, I did think that the dose was a bit too high for me.  I felt very light headed and drowsy after taking th epill but i must say the pill does do its job.	The pill was prescribed to me for recovering from pain after my wisdom teeth were extracted.  It was a very effective pain killer.  All of my wisdom teeth were extracted the same day and I was in excruciating pain once the anesthetic wore off.  As soon as I took thi smedication, I felt great relief.  I was prescribed only 5 pills but I felt much better after taking only 3, 1 every 4 hours.

For as needed manic episodes and severe insomnia--this is great stuff."	Biggest problem is the LONG half-half.  After sleeping for over 10 hours, I spend the next 6 hours after I wake up foggy-headed and VERY lethargic. After this I usually feel good again.	I mainly suffer from severe depression and anxiety but after a couple weeks of this I sometimes suffer from 2 or 3 days of mania.
2970	niaspan	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cholesterol problems	"My cholesterol levels were terrible.  I was around 32 years old with, as the doctor said, ""the cholesterol of a 40 year old man.""  It may have been partly due to my crohn's disease (which was flaring) and the weird way my body was absorbing nutrients at the time. Over the past 4 years my HDL levels have been significantly higher, and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as I wish it was)!"	Niaspan is a high dose of Niacin (vitamin B) and causes a good amount of flushing at a dose of 1000mg.  My cholesterol levels were screwy, and I had a more holistic doctor at the time.  She wanted to avoid drugs that she considered more harsh.  I was instructed to take the dose right before I went to bed.  I took the first dose about an hour before bed, and I turned beet red with the most amazing full-body flush.  Skin on my arms, torso, chest, neck and face was flushed.  I was really hot and really uncomfortable.  I went to lay down and try to sleep, but I couldn't get comfortable.  It was embarrassing because we had a guest staying with us at the time!  After about 15-20 minutes the flush subsided, and I was able to fall asleep.  So it is important to literally take the pill as you're getting into bed.  I've noticed some flushing sort of subconsciously while I'm asleep, but it generally doesn't wake me up.	I started with 1000mg and stayed at that level for about 2 years.  Then, after I moved and changed doctors, my dose was reduced to 500mg/night.  My liver stats were being monitored because of another medication I was taking (mercaptopurine), so I'm relatively sure I haven't had any adverse liver effects with this drug.

1919	climara-pro	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hot flashes	There was a small reduction in my hot flashes but the side effect was bothering me too much to stay on the patch longer to see if it would have totally eliminated them over time.	I developed gas pains in my abdomen where the patch was. I was very bloated and uncomfortable.  I think I gained a couple of pounds too and I had only been using it for a week.	The doctor thought I should try the patch because it would bypass my liver. I have been taking pills for eight years and didn't really have any side effects - so I returned to my original treatment of estradiol and provera.

I sought treatment for frequent severe migrains. I started getting migraines at age 30 and in recent months had been having 2-3 migrains a week. I was taking Imitrex at the initial sign of a migrain (eye aura) but this was had limited effectiveness. My doctor recommended trying Topamax. In the first 2 months I had 2 migrains and have only had 4 in the last 18 months. I take 100mg at bed because it makes very relaxed and sleep very deeply. I very occasionally find myself forgetting nouns and proper names but that has been the only cognitive effect. I still have been able to be effective and focused at my job.

"""I&#039;ve been on this medicine off and on for almost a year now. After I am on it for a few weeks, my joints start to hurt really bad. I think it is because of the diuretic nature of the drug.

I went to the doctor for tooth pain and he chose to treat me for TMJ of which I disagreed. As it turned out the diagnosis was incorrect as I eventually had the tooth pulled and all pain stopped. I did not complete the suggested treatment plan due to mild side effects listed below.	The most uncomfortable was tingling in my arms and legs. Otherwise it was the general feeling that foreign drugs were in my body as I do not usually take any kind of drugs.	The treatment being described as above. I consider it to be a mis-diagnosis and was quite disappointed that a Medical M.D. who not consider that I knew my own body well enough to know what was really wrong. Hence, I was diagnosised and prescribed incorrectly. Knowing this I did not follow through on the treatment plan. The only reason I decided to take the meds in the first place was because a nurse friend of mine also convinced me I should take the meds. They were both wrong.

My cholesterol has always been high during routine blood tests but around a year ago it had risen to 8 mmol/l (almost 300 ml/dl)and my HDL/LDL ratio was poor. Trigylserides were normal before taking Crestor after weight loss.	Surprisingly no side effects with Crestor even though it is the most potent of the statins. I had severe muscle pains with Lipitor and other statins and expected to have the same problems with Crestor. For some reason I didn't have these problems with Crestor.	I was started on 10mg and retested after 10 weeks. My LDL (bad cholesterol) dropped significantly, HDL rose slightly and triglyserides dropped slightly (they were already in the normal range before). My liver enzymes were high before taking Crestor but had returned to normal when retested after 10 weeks (I don't know if Crestor had anything to do with this or not). Blood sugar levels were normal before and after taking Crestor, but slightly lower after. I am due to be tested again before the end of this year and also have a Cardio Stress Test. After a new doctor reviewed my medical history, he suggested I have a stress test even though I still haven't experienced any symptoms of heart disease. All ECG results at rest have been normal.

It would take about 36 hours to start feeling the benefit and about 3 days to get the full benefit.
2117	renova	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles	Some reduction in wrinkles and pores were observied, but I'm not sure if it's the Renova or the Fraxel or the combination.	Slight irritation at first with Renova. Fraxel treatments cause swelling and redness for a few days. Not too bad. But the Renova will sometimes cause skin to peel off and flake - looks bad but only lasts a day.	I'm doing Fraxel treatements once every 4-6 wks, combined with Renova every night (except right after the Fraxel treatment). Some improvement has been observed.

My drug &amp; alcohol physician put me onto Prozac but after just one tablet, I suffered anxiety and was very jittery and almost felt sea-sick and terrified.  He then prescribed Zoloft for me.  What a WONDERFUL drug!  After one day, I felt focussed, clear headed and happy.  I went on to attend Melbourne University as a mature aged student and studied philiosophy - it was amazing.  I&#039;d never felt so intelligent or capable in my life.  I eventually came off Zoloft after a few years and have never looked back.  It may not suit everyone but it certainly was just what I needed!"""

The pain however always did go away and therefore relieving me of it and making me feel comfortable again.	After using the drug for a while I was becoming more and more dependant on it.

The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a ""treatment for the symptoms"". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life."	Constipation, dry mouth and some mild dizziness that would go away after medication was stopped for a few days.	I was given Prilosec prescription at a dose of 45mg per day. Medication was taken once, every morning before eating. Each treatment duration was for 6 months.
2585	pilocarpine	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	high intraocular pressure (glaucoma)	The drug caused the iris to contract so that the drains that relieve fluid buildup causing high pressure are pulled open.  While using the drug the pressure in my eyes remained stable but high.  It had the added benefit of sharpening my vision for a long time so that I did not need to wear glasses for reading phonebooks,etc.	The iris atrophied.  It is now impossible for my pupil to open to adjust to changing light conditions.  The iris aslo scarred to the lense making a followup cataract removal operation complicated.  The drug sped up the formation of cataracts.	The drug in drop form was put in each eye three times a day.  It was a nuisance to have to carry it with me for mid day application.  The chemicals in the drops sting and leave your eyes watering for a minute or so.  Otherwise it was easy to use, although the proper technique for putting in the drops without touching the eyeball takes a little practice and a steady hand
496	meridia	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	obesity	BMI was 36 before I started Meridia.  After 4 monhts, BMI is 28.  Lost 43 pounds.  Increased energy and confidence.  Another benefit was an increase in alertness and confidence.  I had low blood pressure and was quite passive before, and with the medication felt an increase in energy and heart rate.  My behaviour changed - I became more assertive because I was more impatient than before.	Increased heart rate.  After day 9 on Meridia, felt hungry when my body was hungry - constant hunger stopped.	After day 9 on the medication, I no longer had that feeling of starving all the time. When I started Meridia, I also started the Jenny Craig program to educate myself on nutrition and get support.  My knowledge of nutrition was so limited that a nutritionist would not have been able to teach me such basic principles - I needed to be taught like a child.  I didn't know this at the time, but 4 monhts later, I know that was the right thing to do and why.

3787	keflex	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	severe upper respitory tract infection	Mild suppression of the infection, slightly reduced upper respitory tract symptoms, some reduced coughing, some reduced mucus production. The symptoms took at least 5 out of the seven days to begin to dissipate, which is very slow compared to another antibiotic such as Maxamox. Unfortunately the side effects were more noticeable than the treatment benefits, and the prescribing doctor mistook the side effects for another symptom that was not actually present.	Swollen glands, especially in breasts. My breasts became enlarged and very painful, causing my doctor to diagnose pregnancy. Of course this was not the case, as I tested negative for pregnancy, and my doctor was reluctant to believe that the Keflex had anything to do with it. My father noted same side effects after a similar course of Keflex. He developed painful and swollen glands in mouth and neck. Also, the management of the URTI took much longer than with other antibiotics. My symptoms seemed to linger on and on.	I had a severe URTI with bronchial coughing, headache,  muscular and joint pains, and general feeling of fatigue. My doctor presecribed Keflex as an antibiotic, she regarded it as a most effective treatment for this severe URTI. I was to take one tablet (I forget the dosage) once a day for a week to ten days. As I was working I had  no time to rest and had to rely on Panamax to held suppress the symptoms. Unfortunately within a day  my breasts became sore and swollen, and at the end of the week I returned to my GP who tried to diagnose pregnancy when there was not the slightest possibility of this. I finished the course of Keflex, only to take on another antibiotic at the end of the course since the Keflex did such a poor job.

279	xyrem	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	narcolepsy	Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me.	Im sure it causes night sweats and significant weight loss.  Other side effects that may or may not be related that I experience (although I also started taking it after the birth of my first child and may be related to that rather than the Xyrem)were receeding hairline, short term memory impact, some decrease in cognitive function such as difficulty with word recall, following a more complex line of reasoning, etc.., and increased anxiety.  Even given the side effects, my life is so much better now that I am not so exhausted and I can't imagine going back to life before Xyrem.	1 dose right before bed and another 3-4 hours later.

My quality of life was pretty much non-existant as I didn't enjoy anthing because I was always too tired.  When I started provigil I quit feeling like I always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because I had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days.	No negative side effects	Was prescribed 100 mg and could go up to 200 mg as needed.  On a regular day 100 mg was sufficient.  On long days or if I had activities schduled after work I would take another 100 mg tablet or I'd cut a tablet in half to take 50 mg rather than 100 .  I made sure I didn't take anymore after about 6:00 pm or it would keep me awake at night.

I also get tingles in my toes, fingers, and sometimes feel like I have a peice of hair underneith my nose when it's just a tingles in my face. I also do not have an appitite anymore which I am excited for because I used to be on elivil which made me gain 35Ibs. Also switching over from elivil to topamax is veryyyyyyyyyyy painfullll i do always have a constant headache and i'm just waiting for that side affect to go away.	The first week I took I lowered my elivil to 20Mg and started my Topamax and had that at 50Mg for the first week.

It also caused reduction of pain during intercourse. Improved sex drive and response.	The application of estrace didn't appear to have side effects initially, however, upon continued use severe irritation of the vaginal lining occurred as well as a severe yeast infection. Yeast infection was so severe it required prescription medication to clear up.	"""I&#039;ve been on Estrace for just over 2 years to treat Primary Ovarian Failure. I have grown about 3 inches taller, my breasts have not increased in size, they are just constantly sore. I have been getting a lot of discharge, which is not overly pleasant. I get dizzy spells sometimes. I have gained about 15 pounds in 2 years again not the greatest, but my growth could have something to do with it. Acne, comes and goes sometimes it is horrible, other times my skin is great! My feet have also grown 1.5 sizes. I am very moody. That comes along with being young though.

Dry lips, red skin for the first month or so.	Treatment consisted of orally taking two tablets a day.  I was prescribed Cetaphil lotion and lip balm to keep side effects at bay. Roaccutane was an excellent treatment.  Before going on it I spent hundreds of dollars on other anti-acne treatments such as Clearasil etc and had no joy.  Don't waste your money on other treatments just see your GP and ask for Roaccutane if you have an ongoing acne problem.

These patches work like a miracle for me, although others who have used them say they offered no relief for muscle or nerve or shingles pain.  I have bone spurs in my neck which sometimes irritate the nerves in my neck and cause excrutiating pain ... also periodic sciatica and shoulder and upper & lower pack pain from an auto accident.  Chiropractic and message helps, but these patches are used when those interventions fail to bring about sufficient relief ... especially for the nerve pain in my neck. I use them only as a last resort.	Relief of pain!  No bad side effects.	"""When you use it it may still hurt. For me, I put it on before bed and leave until morning. By the morning it is an improvement. Every time it has taken the sunburn off almost completely or fully complete."""
345	neurontin	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	spinal injury	The Lidoderm numbs my back for most of the day so that the pain is dulled dramatically.  The Neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well I was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for 4 1/2 months.  These two pain relievers work so very well together.  There is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  I am also on other medication for this as well. Being able to walk around again finally, was like, what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  I'm not broken, I'm hurt.  I have children at home, I need to at least be mobile!	Many of the medications I take have a side effect that affects your memory.  My short term memory is terrible.  I can be asking for something as ordinary as a fork, a pen, etc. and can not come up with the word, at all.  I'll be able to later, or the next day, I haven;t forgotten the word, I just can;t get it out of my brain.  The Neurontin has also affected my eyes.  I sometimes have problems focusing; sometimes I am able to read the phone book and othertimes I need magnifying glasses.  This all started a week after starting the medicine.	I have a torn lumbar disk.  I have pain in my back that is constant and gets worse with overwork and high humidity.  I have no feeling in my feet.  My right leg does not work correctly.  The Neurontin is mainly attributable to the quality of life that I have today.  Then the other medications I take all do their part.  The Nerontin blocks the pain nerve signal from registering in my brain.  The Methodone deals directly with the pain as does the Lidoderm Patch.  The muscle relaxer keeps my muscles from spontaneously contracting, which they will do without the medication.  The anti-depressents help me stay positive, which is where I want to be.  I usually have a sunny outlook and the medicine helps me keep it.  When my last medicine stopped working, I was depressed for a total of 6 months.  What a waste of time.

I felt more anxious than before starting on this medication, these effects lasted about ten days, i began having headaches which lasted about a week. I carried on taking citalopram for six weeks with no benefit, so my doctor increased the dose to 40mg daily. Four weeks later i decided to stop this medication as I felt like a zombie, as though my thoughts were on a go slow. I quit there and then, which i know is not advisable, but I just wanted to get this drug out of my system. The worst withdrawl symptom I had was the strange dreams/nightmares. I will never forget them, they were so vivid and funnily enough i had not had (remembered) any dreams for the previous five years.

During that time I used only natural toothpaste with no flouride in it.

When I forgot this and lay down straight after I ended up with heart burn.

As for the effectiveness, it doesn&#039;t hurt to breath anymore and my chest does feel a lot better.  I&#039;ve still got a productive cough though so I&#039;m not sure that 7 days worth is enough, but I&#039;m a lot better than I was this time last week."""
1051	femring	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hysterectomy	The Femring is great because you insert it and don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill or pills every day. This allows you freedom for the next three months, (90) days until your reorder a new ring.  Also my insurance pays a good portion of the cost of the ring, whereas it did not cover the cost of bio-identical horomone treatments.	The bad thing about this certain dosage of the Femring was on the third day it seemed as though I was beginning to have vaginal irritation.  The fourth day was obvious vaginal irritation with a blistery rash.  Upon feeling and seeing this rash I removed the Femring and called my Dr.	"""I just started using Fem Ring, after having tried expensive patches that irriatated my skin, messy compounded creams, and drops.  I already have a yeast infection, which never happens, plus low back and abdominal pain.  Outrageous in this day and age, that no enterprising pharma can come up with an estradiol without such hassles.  My body does not like this ring - it is quite hard, large, and terribly uncomfortable,   paid $100 for it, WITH insurance.  Estradiol acetate, which is the kind of estradiol provided in this ring, has to pass through the liver, which is an inefficient way for the body to absorb.  I expected better from Warner Chilcott.
I am returning to my compounded drops, one drop on the pulse, twice daily, $25 for a two month supply."""

After all conventional methods of treatment (e.g., exercises, mouth appliances etc.) and drugs (e.g, ibuprofen) did not alleviate the problem, symptoms or pain, the only option left was surgery.  Because surgery for TMJ conditions is not a guarantee for success, I was reluctant to agree to the procedure.

This drug has worked extremely well for the past 11 years in controlling the pain.

1185	prozac	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Prozac helped in toning donwn my depression. Prozac was effective for the first 5 years then my depression slowly started to become worse. I then had to be placed on Wellbutrin for about 2 years, along with Prozac and yet my side effects from Prozac increassed to the point where I was taken off prozac.	The main treatment side effect began as increased depression and slight shaking in my fingers and hands. Over time the shaking turned into tremors which I could not control. Then I was placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and finally weined off of Prozac and the tremors subsided.	I took Prozac once a day in the morning with my other medications. At first my depression was under control but after about 5 years the depression began to become more intense. I was then placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and my depression soon was improving. However, I started noticing hand shakes which progressively got worse. So after 2 years of Prozac and Wellbutrin I was told to stop Prozac. Within 6 months the shaking/tremors subsided and my depression is now fine by taking only Wellbutrin (150 mg/day)

Adding Cytomel fine tuned treatment and all symptoms resolved.	There were none - all I felt was better.	"""Adding 10mcg of Cytomel to my T4 medicine was just what my body needed to clear up those lingering hypothyroid symptoms that just wouldn&#039;t go away, no matter how good my lab numbers looked or other healthy habits I developed.

It may not work for everyone but it works wonders for me.	The only side effect is a dry mouth.	"""I&#039;ve taken Provigil in the past for over 8  years due to severe IBDH &amp; shift sleep disorder.  When Nuvigil came out on market, my neurologist gave me samples to try.   I found it AMAZING &amp; much cleaner version, as I don&#039;t notice significant side effects.  Most importantly - the abrupt feelings when it first &quot;kicked in&quot; in the mornings and sudden halt from wide awake to severe sleepiness. Less agitated and very clean even transition from its predecessor Provigil!"""
4126	chantix	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	stop smoking aid	Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.	The side effects for patient were 1) an upset stomach directly after taking pill, and 2) VERY disturbing and vivid dreams.  Patient found that, regarding the stomach upset, it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset), than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating, (i.e. eat some food, take the pill, then eat some more).  This method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  As to the vivid dreams, that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  Although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams, the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day.	Chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.  As noted above, the dosage was altered by the patient to alleviate negative side effects.  Although a stop-smoking plan was packaged with the initial prescription, the patient stopped participating in the follow up due to the lack of urges for cigarettes.  This, however, may be why the patient was on the prescription for a year versus a few months.
2838	singulair	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	asthma/allergies	noticed a significant improvement in exercise induced asthma/shortness of breath. Also I previously had a chronic cough/throat irritation prior to taking singulair and this is now gone. My asthma would act up when I drink or eat cold foods and this is no longer a problem. I haven't had bronchitis in over a year and would usually get 3-4 x  year.	Did not notice any side effects. There are reports of depression as side effects but since I suffer from depression anyway it's hard to tell. Haven had any worsening of depression since starting singulair.	Singulair has been very beneficial in controlling my asthma and bronchitis. Do not notice it helps much with my allergies though. I do take zyrtec for allergies but if I run out and still taking the singulair my allerties come right back. When I miss a dose of singulair I notice my cough comes back right away.

7. Bad experience for $200!!!"	Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the Sun. Please be aware, read more information online.
3434	tazorac	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne/anti-agin	This drug did, in fact, erradicate the adult acne I'd been plagued with since turning 29.  I didn't have awful acne, but it was persistent.	When I first began using the product I suffered serious side effects, especially to my neck.  My face became very, very dry and red, and it hurt.  After several weeks of toughing it out, I ended up skipping a nightly dose, and I think that helped.  It allowed my skin to recover a bit so that when I got back on the reginme the following night, I didn't suffer quite as badly.  From that time on, my neck just itched . . . and itched . . . and itched.  After about two weeks, though, my skin acclimated fully.	I was instructed by my dermatologist to wash my face nightly with a benign cleanser, wait twenty to thirty minutes, and then apply a very light film of product to my face and neck.  Be careful not to apply the product directly up against the side of the nose or the nostrils, or you'll suffer irritation.

Unfortunatelt cold fronts and weather changes still bother my joints. This mediicine keeps me active and pretty much able to do most of what I want to do.

2018	bystolic	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	heart palpitations	"I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded."	The beta blocker controls and regulates your heart beat so it beats on time when it's supposed to.  It also however, controls your heart rate and doesn't allow it to race out of control.  So when exercising, many people have a hard time being able to get their heart rate up to pump enough blood to the lungs which is why you feel winded while exercising even mildly.  With Bystolic there is very little of this type of side effect.  Sometimes I don't notice it at all.	"""I have been on this for about 4 years. It worked great and had no side effects. Had to stop taking it because it is too expensive."""

1211	prozac	1	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"My depression was significantly alleviated.  I would still feel bad somtimes, but it never again felt like true depresion.  It was like there was some ""padding"" between me and the bad feelings."	"There were actually no physical side effects, but I found that I said a lot of things I wouldn't normally say, and which I was embarassed about later.  Prozac made me feel like everything was fine, so I didn't take things seriously enough, and didn't take care of things which really needed to be taken care of.  I feel like I wasn't a good parent during that time, because my attitude was ""eh...who cares?...everything is fine"".  

I also had a very hard time withdrawing from it. I tried several times but fell into severe depression and had to start taking it again.  I thought I'd have to be on it for life.  However, once I managed to make it through a full week without it, I felt fine, and have never had to use it again."	I have a long history of depression but had never taken medication for it.  I asked my doctor to prescribe Prozac.  For the first week I felt the same, but I slept almost 24/7 and barely ate. After that I did get a significant relief from the depression.  Unfortunately, as I noted above, I don't like the way I acted during that time, and still cringe with embarassment and/or regret over things I said and did.  But at the time everything seemed so rosy, that none of my behavior bothered me.  Unfortunately, life is not perfect, and as adults we must take things seriously and deal with them.  Prozac kept me from acknowledging that.  Looking back, if I had faced my depression head on, and let it inspire me to make real changes in my life I would have been a lot better off in the long run.

I gained 5lbs after starting it, but it was also winter time and I seem to gain 5 pounds around the holidays anyway.

For years I cried everyday, freaked out at the drop of a hat, yelled all the time, had no self esteem and sometimes thought I could not go on. After two weeks of taking Lexapro I am a completely different person. I have not cried once after the first week of being treated. I love myself and my kids. All the menial tasks that I felt so difficult before, I now do with a great sense of ease. My friends and family notice a huge change in me. I couldn't be happier.
1302	zocor	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	On Zocor my total cholesterol was lowered below 200 and my LDL was lowered below 100. I currently take Zocor 40mg and could probably reduce the amount I take to 20mg if I would dedicate myself to a serious diet and exercise program. I am a nurse and work nights so this is difficult. Zocor has kept my cholesterol down and reduced my risk for cardiovascular problems.	I have had no side effects.	I started out on Zocor 20mg and with diet and exercise was able to keep my cholesterol levels low. However, I started working as a night shift nurse and not eating as well and had to increase my dose to 40mg. This dose has kept my cholesterol levels under control even with lack of regular exercise and not the best diet.

3757	spironolactone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The benefits are helping to control my cystic acne. I used to have very painful acne cysts that caused major scarring on my cheeks and chin. I did use accutane for about 4 months to clear it up. However, I still breakout. Not with cysts but smaller pimples. They seem to form in a cluster in certain areas. I have tried all kinds of topical as well as oral medication to keep these breakouts at bay. Spironolactone has pretty much helped reduce the breakouts to almost non existant. My face is also less oily.	The only side effects were temporary breast discomfort. I swear they got bigger. That however did subside and I no longer have that discomfort. The other side effect is frequent urination. If I drink a lot of water during the day I have to go all the time but even if I don't I still have to when I drink water or whatever. It's a little annoying but the pros far out weigh the cons.	I simply take one 100 mg pill a day after I have eaten and drink plenty of water. I usually take it in the morning. I use spironolactone in conjuntion with Ziana topical cream. This combination has really helped to basically rid me of acne. Thank goodness, since I am almost 27 years old and it is embarrassing to still get acne. I love this stuff!

Tingling in arms and legs, loss of appetite, tiredness, metallic taste, a bit of coordination problem (couple of incidents while backing up the car from garage).

My neurologist and I discussed Topamax and figured it was worth a shot since my chronic, daily migraines were uncontrollable and I was getting Imitrex injections almost every week and could no longer take Toradol. Unlike other people, I have very few side effects. I weaned off Topamax once to try Gabapentin but it by itself wasn&#039;t enough and my migraines returned full force.

3629	retin-a	4	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sun damage	The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however.	There were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after.	"Topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. The recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but I found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face."

The Diazepam made me sleep all the time which was a good thing as I believe the body heals while sleeping	I will never take Diazepam again as it gave me a headache, I had unpleasant dreams and I felt that I was not always here, so trying to focus or remember things was dificult.	The pain in my side was found to be viral hepatitis.  I continued with Diazepam for two weeks.  Treatment then consisted of reducing fat in the diet and not drinking alcohol for 3 months.  I lost a considerable amount of weight as a result.

The symptoms were anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and restlessness. I was administered an uptake test and I received radioactive iodine therapy to slow down my thyroid function.

"""I hope this helps others because I rarely leave feedback. Please stick with Lexapro if you are having side effects. They will subside. I am only on day 9.

Before starting this medication I was experiencing anxiety that blew up quickly, it started happening at night, which effected my sleep, which grew to chronic insomnia for 4 months and that led to me becoming depressed.

There really wasn't anything more to it, but I gather I have to write 50 words, so here they are.	None.	I'm not sure I understand the question. This was pretty simple - I had a tendency to slip into deep depressions without medication. The drugs prevented that without side effects.
2584	betaseron	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	multiple sclerosis	Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  Which, if you have ms this is what you aim for.	I do, for some unknown reason, still have side effects from the betaseron.  They don't happen every injection, and there is no pattern.  I will have a fever and/or chills, and I hurt all over.  It feels sometimes like even my hair hurts:)   And my injection sites do have a tendency to form large red circles, but they are NOT infections, just a side effect.  And for some reason the injections on my legs hurt the worst.	"""First diagnosed with MS in 2000 and started Betaseron then great results. Had mild side effects, including temporary flu like symptoms and sore injection sites, but that was all. Since the flare up that led to my diagnosis, I have only had 5 flares that I knew were flare ups, with only 1 being a more moderate flare up with similar symptoms as the one that got me diagnosed."""

I have far fewer hormonal breakouts around my chin and my skin seems generally less congested with fewer blackheads.  I have also noticed a reducation in oil on the surface of my skin.	This product has made me more sensitive to the sun.  I think my skin has burned or discoloured very quickly after having been in the sun, even while wearing sunscreen.  I have also noticed increased pigmentation on my foreheard and at my temples.	I have been taking this product consistently for about 10 months.  I take one tablet, twice a day with meals - usually one at the beginning of the day, another at the end of the day.
3701	effexor-xr	2	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, axiety	Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so, and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over.	It almost immediately raised my diastolic and systolic blood pressure my 20 and 35 points respectively (up to about 105/170), as well as elevating my heart rate from 75 beats per minute to 95-100 beats. I occasionally experienced difficulty reaching orgasm in the course of sexual activity, but did not experience reduced sex drive or difficulty attaining a full erection (I'm honestly not sure whether to rate this as a side effect or a benefit).	"The benefits of Effexor XR were terrific. The side effects while taking it were just fine with me, though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. That said, the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. I would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. Let me put this into perspective: I've gone through nicotine, alcohol, and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the Effexor was the worst (and I required hospitalization for the alcohol). It took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. I tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at 75% the regular dose, then 50%, and then 25% before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small I had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. Even finally quitting taking the drug at all when I'd tapered down to 1/15th the initial dose, I experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts), night sweats, what I've read in Effexor forums described-inadequately-as ""brain shivers,"" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of 0 mg. If I were at suicidal or bed-ridden level of depression this drug would be completely worth it, even with the withdrawal. Otherwise, I'm staying away from SSNRI's for a long time."

HDL cholesterol is within normal range. Change in diet and weight reduction as recommended by Doctor is contributing to adjustment of cholesterol levels.	It is undetermined whether Pravastatin is responsible for the muscle pain and diarrhea I am experiencing daily.

Sometimes I had some minor swelling at an injection site.  It went away within days.	"""I am a 33 yo mom of 2. Very busy, very active.

I no longer have to void 3-4x before leaving my house to go somewhere. After having cystoscopies done, I was nervous. It wasn&#039;t as bad as I thought.

Also the cream itself was a little to heavy, it may work better for those with dry skin. I did not notice increased sun sensitivity or significant dryness.

None.  Seriously, I could not even tell I had taken a drug, there were no impacts whatsover, either positive or negative.	Took 2 tablets (15 mg) total, once daily in the morning.  Also took Zanaflex, but only at night.  The Zanaflex helped - for about 3 hours.  When I was just on the meloxicam, I was in terrible pain.  The injury being treated was mid-back pain, caused by straining/overusing my back muscles in a ski competition.  I have a 30 day prescription for meloxicam, but I'm calling the doctor tomorrow to ask for something different; this drug is totally pointless for me.

3345	lipitor	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	Noticeably lowered blood pressure and stress level when taken.  If the patient missed a dose, he became more easily agitated.  When the Lipitor was administered, agitation would subside within 1/2 an hour.  The patient has a family history of hypertension, heart disease and sleep apnea.  Therefore, controlling hypertension is a major concern for this patient and may actually save his life.	Erectile function seemed to be mildly affected by this drug.  Sexual performance became slightly more challenging once the patient began taking this medication and was noticeably improved when the patient missed a dose.	Lipitor was administered in pill form.  The patient received the prescription from a sliding scale clinic.  The patient also received a cardiogram, which revealed a 30% blockage.  Alcohol consumption, diet, and exercise are the primary barriers to this patient's health improvement.  He consumes an average of ~6 alcoholic beverages per day.

Patient smoked for several years, but quit approximately 2 years ago.
1670	vioxx	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	possible arthritis	Don't believe that I took it long enough to really tell if it was working. I had an allergic reaction shortly after I started taking it.	"My upper lip swelled up an became rough an mildly itchy. It remained rough and swollen for a week. For another week it just felt ""weird"". There was some  crustiness around my mouth. Hadn't eaten or taken anything else orally that was new to me."

Lower stress level with the migraine due to medications quick action.	I did have some nausea if I took more than one tablet at a time, but I usually fell asleep after taking one then woke up with out my migraine so it was well worth it.	I had been having menstrual migraines for some time and would always end up in the er when ibuprofen and acetaminophen didn't work (i had tried other migraine meds that didn't work either) So my Dr. prescribed percocet, I usually end up taking it once every 3-4 months.
812	ambien	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleep deprivation	I had been having a pro-longed sleep deprivation problem, and was very fatigued and emotionally drained from it. I tried Tylenol PM but i read the negative effects on the liver from taking Tylenol frequently so I discontinued use. I finally went to the doctor to see what they might suggest, and after a consultation, i was prescribed Ambien. After trying it, I discovered that I would go out to sleep very deeply, and have vivid nightmares. I would wake up 3 to 4 hours later every night though, and only be able to go back to sleep very lightly. After a month of that, I gave it up. I ended up taking 5HTP for awhile with melatonin and now I sleep much better.	Nightmares, short sleep time	I was to take 1 nightly for 1 month to see if this helped my problem, then return to doctor for consultation.
4115	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	Eliminated nicotine cravings and made smoking cessation very easy.	Slight stomach naseau if not taken with food.	I set my quit date for 1 week after I started taking the medication, but did not get discouraged when I was unable to meet that goal because I noticed a drastic decrease in my cravings and knew that I could eventually beat this addiction with the help of Chantix. I reset my quit day for 1 week beyond my original date and by my second quit date, I was no longer craving a cigarette. I was able to quit smoking after only 2 weeks on the medication. I no longer craved one when I woke up, after I ate or when I got in my car. It was amazing and I like to call this my little miracle drug. =)

91	pristiq	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	depression decreased while on this drug	I experienced minimal side effects, the only side effect was loss of appetite and weight loss which in my opinion isn't exactly a bad thing.  The other side effect that I experienced was loss of emotion, I was neither happy nor sad.  This is what made me stop taking the medication.

Apparently 1 in 10,000 people experience this side effect so it is rare.

Lose of appetite and change in taste buds.  This was mild and not a problem.

Its the fingernail thinness that really bothers me.  I thought my nails would go back to normal but they haven't.  They are still paper thin and splitting every time I try to pick anything up with my nails.  Its very irratating. 

But my toenails look great."	1 tablet daily for 15 weeks.  I would have stayed on longer if I didn't experience the vertigo.  I just wanted to ensure that the fungus would not come back.  But it was 3 months before vertigo became an issue.
2122	renova	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	for treating wrinkles	Early this year I started noticing my skin around the eye beginning to lose its firmness: wrinkles formed during sleep could not be smoothed out by using Lancome eye cream.  Though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  I was very self conscious about the wrinkles. After using Renova (I've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic.	"For the initial two weeks, where I applied Renova caused a stinging sensation and a mild redness.  My eyes were watery for a few weeks as well.  Also, for that initial few weeks, the skin looked dry and the wrinkles looked worsened in that one-hour ""drug-work"" duration for which I didn't put on any moisturizer.  All the symptoms are gone now, and the skin is denser and firmer and I no longer fear people looking at my wrinkles anymore."	I asked the doctor to prescribe Renova to me.

It helps me to make decisions, I can complete activities, i talk a lot, i stay in a good mood, but just while is during the effects.	My heart beats faster and i feel its not in a constant rhythm. My mouth is dry and I feel extremely anxious, and because of this, very clumsy.	"""Absolutely awesome. I was suffering from Narcolepsy. Now, I am able to do anything that I want. Quiet amazing. I feel that I was always only able to achieve about 25%. Now I am around 100%."""
3419	tazorac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	facial acne	Always prescribed together with topical antibiotics such as Klaron.  Quite effective in curing acne, but takes months and situation gets worse in the first week to month.	Tazorac can peel the skin severely when used together with other medication.  Still moderate peel when applied once every night.	I'm an Asian female in my 30s and have been having moderate acne problem for over 20 years.  Amoung over-the-counter medication, only benzal peroxide works for me, but I still have break-outs from time to time.  My primary care doctor prescribed Tazorac and Klaron for me about 2 years ago and it was very effective in clearing up the acnes in a few months.  But even the prescription cannot fully cure the problem and doesn't prevent future break-outs.

I was presribed to take the Vicoden PRN for pain every 4-6 hours.
1967	lyrica	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pinched nerves	Lyrica really helped my pinched nerves and radicuopathy in my legs. I would go to bed in terrible pain and sometimes couldn't even lie down because my lower back and legs would cause me so much discomfort. When I woke up I couldn't feel my legs and could barely walk. Lyrica makes it easy and painless to sleep and in the morning I can walk and drive without worrying if my legs will go numb.	After taking Lyrica I developed tinnitus. I started hearing Morse code, music, and running water. I was also checked for ear problems and schizophrenia and the tests were negative. It did cause some drowsiness and made it hard to get up in the morning for the fist two or three weeks, but overall it has been a blessing. No weight gain either, although my doctor did warn me it could happen.	Take as recommended by your doctor.
1322	prevacid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	stomach ulcers	After approximately two weeks of first using Prevacid, I noticed significant improvement in my symptoms.  Within 2 months, the symptoms had completely been resolved.	No side effects at all.	I began experiencing serious stomach pains and persistant diarrhea.  Friends and family suggested that I had irritable bowel syndrome and I thought I would just have to deal with it.  My symptoms progressed to the point that I was barely eating and had lost a significant amount of weight.  I consulted with a gastroenterologist who performed an endoscopy.  I was diagnosed with multiple stomach ulcers and was prescribed Prevacid 15 mg capsules to take once daily.  Within 2 weeks of taking the medication, I started to notice improvement in my ability to eat certain foods.  Within one month, I could eat practically anything with only an occasional onset of symptoms.  After 2 months, I was no longer having any problems.  My doctor recommended that I continue taking the medication and I did so for approximately one year.  I have had no problems since discontinuing the medication so it definitely resolved the problem.
367	neurontin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia due to peri-menopause	Improved sleep, reduced night sweats.  I was experiencing extremely severe insomnia as a result of hormonal fluctuations.  I was down to about 2-4 hours of sleep a night and had tried many approaches, including meditation, herbal supplements, etc.	There are no noticeable side effects, although I wake up a bit more groggy.  However, there is no hangover effect.	"I have been using Gabapentin as an off-label approach to minimize night sweats and adrenalin ""rushes"" at night that caused sleep disturbance.  I began with 100 mgs and increased dosage to 400 mgs which was effective.  I understand from my OB/Gyn that most people can use smaller doses (100-300).  I am really grateful to have this help!"

"There was terrible side effects while on the treatment  but even worst when she tried to stop the medication.  While on the treatment the worst side effect was the suicidal thoughts   .  Also  constant dry mouth , headaches .

 I think every doctor should inform patients of the withdrawal side effects of this  drug ."
1740	topamax	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	"My conclusions of the medication are that it has definately lessened the amount of migraine headaches that I was encountering. I have not had to have an emergency hospital visit in almost a year. This went from a visit occuring almost every other month with horrible painful headaches in between this time. I still get headaches which are tollerable, and if I have a migraine have not had to go to the hospital for pain relief. It has been tolerable. I have now gotten my dose down to 15mg at night time only and am still having the same benefit. My only side effect were some memory difficulty in the beginning. I drove to my doctors office and became disoriented. Rather than panic I laughed it off and pulled over and had to think about where I was going.
It has definately had a positive influence on the migraines. It seems to have some sort of effect on eating though. I did loose a bit more weight which I did not need to loose, but now have been able to be back at my normal weight."	Some forgetfulness,, tiredness at onset. Nothing unbearable.	25mg morning and night. 9 months, then went to 15mg capsules morning and night for a few months. Now down to 15mg at night time only.
160	zomig	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraines	Before when I had a migraine headache I used to be in agony for at least 48 hours. I would have to go to bed because the pain was so bad. I could hardly see and my stomach would be so upset that I would be sick to my stomach. Nothing that I tried ever worked. With the zomig, usually within 1-2 hours and sometimes less I would have tota relief of my migraine headache.	I had no treatment side effects.	It was recommended that as soon as I felt the migraine coming on that I take a zomig tablet. The one that I take is the rapimelt that I put under my tongue and it melts usually in less than a minute. I find that I usually het relief within in 1 -2 hours.
2624	depo-provera	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	The main benefits were absolutely no pregnancy and no menstrual cycles.	The main side effects, which I noticed more predominately in the later stage of treatment was the contast hunger and weight gain as the result, moderate acne, and depression (I am still being treated for depression so this may not be due to depo, but it is actually one of the side effects).	I started depo-provera when I was 15 years old and continued treatment for five years and then stopped treatment at the suggestion of my doctor to take a break from it.  During the first ive years on depo, I had no adverse effects I maintained a constant weight of 112-1/2 pounds throughout the entire five years.  I started depo again at the age of 23 and was fine and maintained a constant weight until they switched me to the generic version at the age of 27 from that point on I struggled with constant hunger rapid weight gain and struggling to keep it under control, acne is another of the side effects I experienced after the switch to generic and depression.  The depression could be the result of fluxuating weight and acne or heredity.  I stopped depo treatment and switched to the copper IUD in November of 2007 and since then the constant hunger has stopped, I have already lost 10 pounds without really trying and the acne is beginning to decrease.  I still am receiving treatment for depression at the moment.  Hopefully, this will help you in your birth control decision.

3829	lumigan	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	eyelash growth	The upper and lower eyelashes grew longer, thicker, and darker.  There is less need for mascara or eyelash curlers with this product.  Lumigan contains the same active ingredient that Latisse will contain when it is released but the difference is that Lumigan is prescribed as a glaucoma medication while Latisse will be marketed and sold as an eyelash growth product.  It does work.	I developed dark under eye circles, itching, redness and a slight headache after each use but I was told that the under eye circles and headaches I experienced were less common side effects.  Once the treatment was stopped all of the side effects disappeared including the dark under eye circles. Also, once the treatment is stopped the eyelashes eventually return to their original state.	I was told to use it once a day at night and to apply it with clean brush.  It is important to try to keep the bottle from having direct contact with the skin in order to avoid contamination.  I used a new eyelash brush daily and Latisse contains once a day applicators.
2802	wellbutrin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	"The idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  At day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  I did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 I felt an eversion to smoking.  
Niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 
The prescription is typically for 3 months but I didn't need any refills at all.  I stopped taking the drug after a month or so.
I recommend this drug ONLY UNDER THE CARE OF A PHYSICIAN to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  
Certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money."	"The most obvious side effect for me was difficulty sleeping.  
Hard to take but I knew that it would be temporary and I knew that I would rather have spotty sleep for as much as a few weeks in trade for not smoking ever again.
The difficulty sleeping didn't last long into the treatment, though.  A week maybe.  
I remember reading about other side effects like a dry mouth, but the most alarming one is possible seizures.  Talk to your doctor."	"""Wellbutrin is amazing. Prior to Wellbutrin I was put on Zoloft, Prozac and Valdoxan, all which either killed my sex drive, did nothing or made me too sleepy to function. For 2 years I stupidly went off medication and just thought everything in life was crap, and probably said somethings I regret to people. Eventually it came to the point where was failing at work and angry at everyone. The ADHD medication I was taking also worsened my depression.

Come Wellbutrin, I have been on it for around two months and I feel great. I have energy, more motivation, increased libido and I feel content, although I still get the moments. Also I have lost more than 5 pounds without dieting or exercising."""
2870	aldactone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	adult acne	Results were almost immediate. My mild cystic acne went away just after taking the pills for a week. Two months later, it's still gone.

1975	lyrica	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain in my legs	relieved the pain	swelling, weight gain, fatigue	I was prescibed lyrica for pain in the leg.  It was caused by an impinged nerve in my back.  Since weight gain was a side effect of the medicine, although it did releive my pain, it made it harder for the swelling in my back to go down.  In the end, I came off lyrica and immediately dropped 20 pounds and the nerve was no longer impinged.

This medication always makes me nauseas if I take it with other vitamins or other medication such as Advil.	I switched from 12 hour to 24 hour however feel that the 12 hour tablet met my needs better than the 24 hour tablet.  The 24 hour tablet seemed to run out of steam and during the heavy allergy season, my syptoms would reappear.
1949	lyrica	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	periferal neuropathy	Definite lowering of feet and leg pain, numbness and foot-sensory control.  However due to the length of diagnostic time required and the progressiveness of the problem, Cymbalta (in a.m.) and Lyrica (in p.m.) work well together.  The neuropathy does not both me at night, once I am laying down and settled.	Some dizziness, balance, and memory issues.  Some days are fine, others are disconcerting but livable.	Lots of testing at the Mayo Clinc (unmedicated) and then medicated with Lyrica, eventualy Cymbalta was added and works quite well about 60% of the time.  Prolonged walking or standing, driving over an hour,the wearing or shoes with backs, and socks exacerbate the neuropathy.  Some lower leg and foot therapy and massage also assists for short periods by releasing endorfins(?).
2026	protonix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	Within two days, the severe burning pain of the GERD disappeared. At three months of treatment, the pain from the ulcer has receded considerably. Because of the ulcer, however, I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic--very fresh pasta sauce with chunks of tomato--or too spicy.	Shortly after starting treatment, I developed diarrhea. It only lasted for a few days, but then I continue to have somewhat pasty stools, with occasional bouts of diarrhea again.	I went to the ER with severe burning in the chest. The doctors there suspected either cardiac problems or a blood clot in the lungs. Once they made certain there were no blood clots, and that the EKG and cardiac enzyme levels were normal, they started me on IV protonix. The next day I was switched to pill form of the protonix, and the improvement was amazing. Within thirty-six hours the pain was minimal, and by the third day of treatment, it was virtually gone. Since then, I haven't had any recurrence, and remain on the protonix only because of the ulcer, which is improving, even though at a slower pace. Overall, it's an excellent medication, and had worked wonders for me.

The low dose of HGH is something that needs to be considered as it really border a theraputic level. The bad side is the cost...500 per month at 1 cc per day.

1310	fexofenadine	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	seasonal allergy	"Controlled itching in eyes, nasal and chest congestion, and ""tickle cough"" very well"	No direct side effects but I used to take OTC allergy med (loratidine) except during extreme periods, then I would switch to the prescription for two months or so.  Now the allergy seems unresponsive to the over the counter medication, no matter what time of year it is.  I do not know if my allergy has changed or if I have become dependent on the fexofenadine.

1271	provigil	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder with severe lows & fatigue,	I do feel much more awake, but I still need a nap everyday even after taking both of my doses. With 8-10 hours of sleep I'm still very fatigued, but I am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. My mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. The endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage, and the only way that I could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on ANYTHING other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me.	Acne!!!!!!!!!! ACNE!!!!! I had a bit of anxiety when I first began taking it, but that has since gone away. My heart raced for a couple of weeks, but It's hard to tell if it really was the provigil simply because my heart often races at random. I had a bit of trouble sleeping the first 3 nights after taking provigil, but this hasn't been a problem AT ALL since. I have lost some weight that I had gained back just before starting provigil, and this has left my husband and therapist a little concerned, but I still get hungry and have not changed my diet...but the provigil IS the cause and I have no doubt about it. I did not refill it for three weeks earlier this year and gained nearly 10 pounds...so this drug would be fairly effective for weightloss.	My bipolar disorder is often at the lowest points more than the highest points anymore. In the past I switched moods much more rapidly and was given the diagnosis of Rapid cycling bipolar disorder. After my first daughter was born it only got worse. Weeks without any sleep! Then when my second daughter was born something changed within me. I couoldn't wake up at night to even hear her cry. My husband took vacation time to stay home to let me rest. I relapsed worse than ever with my eating disorder and required my 3rd feeding tube and I just could not function enough to even take care of myself, normal life or even my baby girls. I was go into fits of rage from the sheer exhaustion and would CLEAN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS without eating , drinking, sleeping or even sitting! Then I would crash! Finally my doctor decided to jusy try provigil, and it has helped a great deal along with cymbalta. I'm not sure why becasue according the everything I know about both medications...they are completely wrong for me. However, nothing else has worked thu far. I have taken EVERYTHING! This has been a dream for me even if I don't have as much pep in my step as I would like....I'm not a blank, lifeless, useless zombie.
626	nortriptyline	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	back pain; restlessness	"I was suffering from mild back pain for a sports injury and also insomnia.  Not only was my back pain temporarily eliviated, I got uninterrupted sleep while I was taking this medication.  Before then, I hadn't slept for almost a week straight.  It was very important that I allowed at least eight hours of sleep.  I made the mistake a couple of times of taking it when I wasn't going to get a full nights sleep and ended up severely drowsy and unalert.  On those two occasions, I ""made-up"" for the missed hours of sleep and over slept.  This did not help, as it furthered my sleepiness.  I sort of had to get on a schedule again.  

When taken properly, it can be very helpful."	Drowsiness if not enough time is available to sleep.  8 hours.	To treat aches and pain associated with back pain and insomnia.

21	sanctura-xr	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	overactive bladder	With OAB there was the urge to urinate frequently which felt like a constant mild bladder infection.  There was some relief after a couple of days on this drug. However, some days I felt as poorly as I did without them.  But after approximately 8 weeks almost all of the discomfort was gone.  I feel pretty normal.  One key to making this work is to deliberately not urinate too often.  I have noticed that now I sometimes need to remind myself to go.  I probably feel the urge less than I did before I had this problem.	Dry mouth if I fast from food.  If I eat normally this does not happen.  Other than that, no side effects.	Take one capsule in the morning before eating breakfast - on an empty stomache.

I don&#039;t recall discussing any of these symptoms with my doctor but it wasn&#039;t till with third month that I noticed the wait gain. Through out using this pill I have found myself way more emotion than I usually am.
My anxiety has reached its peak even though I&#039;ve worked really hard to keep it under control I get irritated for almost anything. 
My sex drive has gone from 4 days a week to once every 2 weeks. Maybe. 
Me and my partner are both very sad about it even though he hasn&#039;t left me. I feel like if we didn&#039;t come to this conclusion he might have. Definitely switching to something different."""

There still was the occasional small white head and they generally healed quickly and left little to no scarring.	There were no visible side effects that I was aware of. My only complaint was that it took about 3 months before I noticed that the occurance of medium to large pimples had stopped.

2406	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothroidism after radioactive iodine	Medications for the graves disease were not keeping the thyroid levels at a constant state. Had to continually change dosage. The medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. I was anticipating having children within a few years. I went in and had the radio active iodine. After one month my thyroid was destroyed. Had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. My doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least 5 years.	When taking synthroid it must be taken on an empty stomach around the same time every day. Multivitamins with Iron decrease the sythroids effectiveness so they must be taken at least 3 hours after taking sythroid. Never miss a dosage. I once missed a few days in a row and became very depressed almost suicidal. Will need to take sythroid for the rest of my life and keep regular appointments to have my thyroid levels checked.	The radio active iodine treatment was conducted as outpatient surgery at the local hospital. I was given a pill to swallow. I was then asked to come back after 6 hours to have a scan done of my thyroid. I came back the next day for another scan. After one week I had a blood test and was perscribed synthroid. I have my thyroid checked on an annual basis. In some cases depending on any changes in my thyroid levels I have had to go back on a six month check up schedule.

I go to a life extension doctor that after testing found that my hormones like all older persons were low so I&#039;m now supplementing with HGH, Pregnalone, DHEA, and Testosterone (transdermal. I highly recommend it to my friends and acquaintances and to you to have your blood tested."""
1593	xanax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/depression	I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.	lethargy, loss of appetite.	I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression.

1393	pamelor	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	This medication was greatly effective in alleviating my depression, more effective than SSRIs or SNRIs I have tried.  Also, the effects did not seem to wear off with time (over the course of treatment, 9-12 months) which I experienced with celexa and effexor xr.  The facial pain was also decreased, this medication is also used as a treatment for nerve pain.	"One of the most unfortunate side effects of all tricyclic antidepressants for many people is weight gain.  I was 'lucky' that I did not gain weight, but I was almost totally unable to lose weight despite diligent nutrition and exercise.

The medication also increased my heart rate.  I was unable to take it at night (which is the common prescribing practice) as the accelerated heart rate would keep me awake.  Taking it in the AM seemed to work around this problem but may have caused some daytime fatigue/sleepiness (this is why is it usually prescribed to be taken at night)."	"""This has helped reduce the severity of my attacks. They are still incapacitating, but the vomiting is not as severe. Unfortunately, it has not affected the amount of attacks I get."""

With the combination of the Obagi skin care, my skin also became uniform in color overall and the darker or brown spots faded which helps to make my skin look even better.  I don't have much wrinkles to speak of except minimal ones around the eye area and laugh lines around the mouth which I did not notice any change or improvement on that.  Pimples after an initial phase of getting worst got better and during the monthly period is lesser than before treatment. Definite improvement on that!	Itching, peeling, irritated skin. Appearance of pimples on the shoulder and back of the neck if I apply Retin A on that area.	"Retin A applied with the Obagi skincare products at night before going to bed.

3944	prilosec	4	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	It somewhat relieved my heartburn for a few days.	No side effects.	Because of the high cost of my prescription Previcid, I tried Prilosec OTC.  It seemed to calm my heartburn for about 3-4 days.  Then the heartburn returned along with nasaus.  I continued Prilosec for about 10 days, but my heartburn became too intense and I reverted back to Previcid.  Previcid seems to be the only drug that completely stops the heartburn.

1228	ultracet	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	tooth infection	There were no benefits to this treatment.	I had a tooth infected went to the dentist for exam and antibotics, and he gave me Tramadol. I took it from 10/14/2008 to 10/16/2008 early am every 4 to 6 hrs 2 pills for pain. I woke up Thursday around 2 am took 2 more as prescribed was unable to walk due to muscle spasms. I could not go to the bathroom due to pain just made the barrel by the bed and crawled back in the bed stopped taking the pain pills after this. My Husband took me to the Doctors office carefully assisting me as I could not walk. I was paralized with extreme severe pain. He made a make shift ambulance out of a ford escort in the back making a bed and I crawled carefully in pain and laid there. The Physician office told me go to the Emg. room St Michaels Hospital. I was unable to get out of the back of the car. With assistance it took a good while to get me out and to lean on a wheelchair to try and walk with constant spasms and pain. I finally got to a bed in the emergency room and laid on my side. In less than 1 hour I had 2 shots in my rear and one in my arm informing I was having severe adverse reactions to the meds. They went from the top of my shoulders, down my back, to my stomach and legs. This was worse than having a baby and I had 3. I am still laid up today and have had a leave of absence due that I am unable to walk or sit at present. I am very upset at the slow process and the information on side affects do not talk about these adverse affects.  My physician took blood and urine samples for a possible muscle problem that this adverse reaction can cause.  Waiting for the results.

The sleep was more refreshing and I woke up without the typical sleeping pill ""hang-over"".  Even while falling asleep you I didn't feel like I was all of a sudden blind-sided by a brick wall and forced to sleep.  This feels much more natural and real than other medications I have tried."	At first, very vivid and biazarre nightmares and dreams.  These gradually became less severe and less violent or frightening and now I dream normally (for me) and have no other side effects that I have become aware of yet.	The Lunesta was prescribed to me by my nephrologist as a part of treatment for continued insomnia.  This has been a long term problem and in the past I have tried Remeron (which should be banned...horrible side effects and hangovers), Ambien, which is also very good and Ambien CR...that was wonderful.  Currently I am happy with this treatment.

Dry mouth and lips	"""I took this medication for four years, all the while becoming less and less interested in sex and unable to achieve an erection. Having gone through 4 cardiologists not a one of them ever informed me that Aldactone is an anti-androgen which blocks muscle and bodily binding of testosterone necessary for it to take effect and also lowers production of testosterone itself. I had to happen upon it on my own. The day I found out is the day I stopped taking it. Giving a male a medicine which renders his testosterone ineffectual may be good for those undergoing a sex change but not for those who are not. There is another potassium sparing drug like Aldactone without the sexual side effects but it is more expensive. """
3811	solodyn	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	folliculitis of scalp	Solodyn contains minocycline and is formulated to be taken once a day. This was very convenient and easy to remember. It can be taken with or without food. The Solodyn seemed to reduce the number of inflammatory lesions, and reduced irritation and itching was considerably.	After a couple of weeks, the Solodyn produced heartburn and nausea. This was very uncomfortable, enough to disturb sleep at night. Solodyn also makes skin sensitive to the sun, so I had to remember to apply sunscreen every day, with at least a moderate SPF (SPF 30+). Healing and resolution of the folliculitis seemed slow, taking months.	"""I started taking solodyn 80mg for a month after stopping my birth control and developing cystic acne as a result of stopping it. I have the giant cystic ones that come back worse every time I stop an antibiotic for acne (2 rounds of doxy, 1 round of minocycline). So I took it for 8 weeks total and noticed significant hair loss over those eight weeks with mild improvement in my acne. I got less giant pimples that were deep and under the surface, but within 1.5 weeks of stopping, I have them probably worse than ever. Felt tired and lazy most of the time while I was on it and had trouble focusing. Not worth the side effects for minimal improvement. Hope you have better luck."""

I believe I tore the hip flexor several years ago in a yoga class and it never healed properly. Sitting at a desk for work aggravates the pain, and I bike every day which isn't good for it either.

I did not put it on near my eyes but somehow the whole area around my eyes is bright red and very sensitive. (I look like a raccoon.)  It burns my face - especially around my eyes - when I use any moisturizer or sunscreen. I had to switch to a milder cleanser to reduce irritation.	My dermatologist prescribed this with a water pill and some kind of anti-bacteria medicine to treat my acne.  I have been on Yaz for a year and it has not helped my acne at all. All over the counter medicines have been ineffective.  I mostly break out around my period and I only get pimples where I have hair folicles.

I am not sure how long it will last, but I will take the relief for now. I have suffered with terrible back pain for going on 8 years, and until I was prescribed valium and Norco combination, I was still in excruciating pain. The combo eases the muscle spasms and basically stops all pain in my lower back. When I awake, I am hurting, but within 20 minutes of taking meds, I am my old, 25 year old self again.	I have experienced NO side effects other than feeling high, a little off-balance, and sleepy. I actually take the Valium at work and have had NO problems whatsoever,	I am very happy with my doctors prescribed meds, and hope Valium continues to work for me in the same manner it has so far. I would highly recommend this combo for anyone having back pain or anxiety. As I live and work a very hectic job, the Valium effects are a plus to keep me on an even keel, allowing me to do my work with a more mellow attitude.

When I first started taking it, I felt odd.  I can't describe it except to say I felt out of sorts.  I had trouble with perspiring and being cold and overly warm.  I would feel cold inside and chilled sometimes and then I'd feel very warm and start to perspire.	I'm taking this because I have trouble with details.  Things like where I parked my car.  I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water and open the refrigerator.  I come out of a business and walk around aimlessly because I have no clue where my car is.  Things are much better now, I rarely have occurrences like this any more.

4121	chantix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	smoking	WOW. I find this drug to be a powerful cocaine antagonist and nicotine antagonist.	mild constipation but relieved with fiber rich diet and liquids, strange taste and some deja vu/strange mental sensations. Cocaine Antagonist (positive)	"I took this drug with the intentions of quitting smoking. I also however, discovered on accident that this drug just about completely blocked the euphoric effects of cocaine and then subsequently blocked the ""crash"". All that would be experienced was a racy heart and undesirable ""too much caffeine"" feeling with nausea. This drug has a SERIOUSLY powerful effect on the euphoric of stimulants and needs to immediately be put into treatment plans for stimulant abuse. For Its indications, nicotine, It definately does its job here too my cravings for nicotine are pretty much extinguished though there still seems to be slight reward in an occasional cigarette, just goes to show how much I feel this drug stabilized my ADHD downsides such as deficient dopamine function in my brain. It worked better than bupropion. I understand Chantix has some issues with side effects but hopefully they will work those kinks out because this really looks to be a miracle drug."
1332	prevacid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	excess stomach acid.	Reduced acid production to normal levels.	At prescribed level of 30 mg/day I suffered fatigue and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. At half this dose I was fine. But, needed dosage levels are different for different people.

1586	xanax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	I had severe anxiety attacks and once they would start it was very difficult to decrease their intensity.  My heart beat got as high as 160bpm on two occasions.  I found the .25mg Xanax pills to be very strong so I only would take 1/4 of a pill, which was enough to stop the attack or prevent one if I felt one coming on.	The only side effect I experienced with Xanax is sleepiness.  I decreased my dose to 1/4 a pill of a .25mg pill.  I still got sleepy but not as bad.	I took Xanax on a prn basis.  Currently I am not taking it at all.  I was diagnosed with panic disorder and fortunately was perscribed Xanax.  Xanax helped prevent panic attacks and allowed me the opportunity to explore non-medicinal forms of managing the attacks.

3636	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne, anti-aging	The retin-a seems to have minimized some of my fine lines, and has helped clear my pores, greatly reduced blackheads and minimized white-heads, and almost erradicated cystic blemishes altogether.  I believe the product does actually promote quick cell turnover based on the results I have seen thust far.	I have been fortunate to have only experienced minimal irritation.  Initially, I had tightness, dry feeling on my face, with some peeling or shedding.  This subsequently caused some itching, but, again, no irritation or pain.  I noticed when applied to active blemishes, the blemish seemed to worsen, become redder,and seemed like it wouldn't heal, but I have combated that by adding a good, natural moisturizer into my routine after the application.	I started using .05 % retina-a every evening after cleansing, but making sure my face was completely dry.  Only a small amount of the cream was needed.  I applied it carefully, avoiding lips and inner eye area.  Afterwards, I used a non-greasy, non-comedogenic moisturizer to minimize dryness, flaking and irritation.

Dealing with lifes regular ups and downs all became stressful if I didnt have it.  Had to stop taking it as soon as I noticed my behavior.	I want to say it was 50 mg. doses taken up to 3 times a day.  It was somewhat up to me when I needed to take it.  Mostly for anxiety attacks.
2727	elavil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression, tension headache	Good for sleep and to ease a tension headache and restlessness. You should take it only at beadtime, don't take it before driving a car. For me there are no side effects because of low dose probably. Ideal to balance your mood and improve your life quality.	Sleepiness on the following day	I started to have it after a nervous breakdown due to panic attacks. First I had 3 tablets a day, but then, with time went by decreased a number of tablets. I still need it two-three times a week when I feel heaviness in my head and it helps in 1 hour after taking it. Highly reccomend for those in depression, with the tension headache and difficulties with sleep.

1077	effexor	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	After taking Effexor for several weeks, I felt decreased anxiety and generally more stability in my moods.  This anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but I think it did help make things easier to handle and, in general, neutralized most life experiences.	I don't recall any severe side effects other than occasional tinnitus. The more severe side effects became apparent after I began attempting to discontinue use of the medication. At that time, although I withdrew from the dosage in very small amounts over a long period, the tinnitus was quite pronounced, especially after any sudden head movements.  I often felt dizzy for no reason.	I'm not sure exactly what information you are requesting here but treatment started with a relatively low dose, escalating to a higher one.  This was done in reverse when I decided to stop taking Effexor.  In retrospect, I'm not sure how much it helped me but had I known how difficult it would be to stop taking the medication, I probably would have asked my doctor for an alternative.

I had no appetite which caused me to lose 10 pounds in a month. Also not having an appetite made me not eat enough, so I would get more headaches because I wasn't eating enough. I also felt very depressed on this medication. During the time I was on topamax I slept a lot and didn't eat enough, I didn't feel like I was myself.

3645	retin-a	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Since using the Retin-A along with the Accutane, I have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.	It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall.	I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.  I will have to continue the Retin-A for at least a year.

Went from smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day to about 5-10 the first day.  By the end of the first week a was smoking 1 or 2 a day.  Quit before the 10 days were up.  1.5 years later, I am still not smoking.	Very irritable and angry.  Fell into a depression.	"Within the first week I was very irritable but that is to be expected. I've quit for a couple of months before and this happened, too.  However, I completely changed.  I could not control my temper, I got very depressed. I didnt realize what was happening other than I just felt ""bitchy"".  After 3 weeks  I quit using the drug from 2/day to 1/day for a few days then quit.  Total I used it for about a month.  

I went into a severe depression in which I was either very angry, very sad or just felt numb. I cycled between those feelings. Nothing brought me pleasure, the things that used to love to do like dancing or  going out with friends, did nothing for me.  I didn't care to do them. I thought I was going crazy. I was like this for about 4 months before I started feeling a little better and maybe about 6-7 months before I felt like myself again.  

I still get occasional cravings but the thought of going through that again keeps me away.  I consider it to be effective but would recommend joining a support group or going to a counselor to help cope with the mood swings.  If you don't have someone you see on a daily basis that can point out those changes I would highly recommend the latter.  I didn't realize that i had fallen into a depression until months into it."

1828	yasmin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cure for acne	Well i started having acne by the age of 18, but it wasnt like normal acne,big and red, it would only stay on the surface of the skin and it was white,it was like little dots all over my face.I used all the creams you could imagine but none of them worked,or would work for a few days and the pimples would come back again. I went to this dermatologist and he said that what could be causing my acne is the hormones balance, (if you have too much feminine or masculine hormones it can cause acne)so he said i could try to take birth control pill to balance my hormones. and so i started. In the first month my acne got worse,but i still kept taking Yasmin(birth control pill), on the third month i started noticing that my skin was clearing from all those pimples.I have been taking it for more than 6 months now and i have no acne! sometimes one or two comes out but it goes away in 2 days.So Yasmin worked for me and could work for you too!

No more white scaly skin cells, no more red patches and lumps, which i think was inflammation, no more slight soreness, whilst using the cream.		I applied the gel to my face-underneath the eyes and on both sides of my nose twice a day for two months initially. There was a great improvement though it didn�t get rid of the condition completely.  I found the sun agravated the condition and the rednes and scaly skin would return and then I would use the cream for about a month until the rosacea disappeared.
2395	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	low under active thyroid	I became more active and lost 10 of the 14 pounds I had gained.  I have more energy, and feel like myself again.	I never had any side effects.  The only drawback is that you have to take the medication on an empty stomach or wait three hours after you eat.  However, they prefer you take it in the morning.  So what I do is keep my medicaton next to my bed and take it the very first time I wake up in the morning whether it's 4, 5, or 6 am.	I returned from vacation in August by November I had gained 14 pounds.  I did not know why.  I was eating the same amount of food.  I went to see the doctor and after a complete check up and blood tests they found I had a low under active thyroid.  As I think back, I did feel more tired, I did not want to join my kids and spouse to do anything instead I would go to bed early.  That is not like me.  I am the type of person who would get up and go anytime.  I thought I was just tired.  Now, I reflect and remember that I stopped doing things with my family, became less active and all along I thought it was because I was tired when in actuality my thyroid was off.

The confusion, being in a daze part was the worst.  I couldn't remember where my Doctor's office was located and I live in a small town and less that two miles from his office.

3310	zoloft	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	I found the treatment was very helpful exspecially around my menstral cycle. I use to feel like I could crawl out of my skin two weeks before my period after starting zoloft I notice a considerable difference.I also felt anxious and restless which has subsided with the use of the zoloft.	I did not seem to be subjected to any side effect. I was concerned about weight gain, fatigue and uncontrolled hunger but I did not have any of these side effects.	First you must be diagnosed with either anxiety or mild to moderate depression. You begin at a lower does to see how you manage with that then eventually if need be your perscriber can increase the dose. Their is no special time of the day to take it and you do not have to eat with it. The most important thing is it does not alter how you feel through out the day you do not get a sensation of being high or druged. There is no lasting effect, if you stop the drug it is out of your system the next day.

3094	minocycline	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne	Decreased the number of acne lesions.	"Major Headaches
Neck Pain"	"I have been taking minocycline 100mg twice a day. At first I had no side effects what so ever. However after a week I started heaving headaches and they gradually got worse. It was when I started having neck pains, I stopped using Minocycline. Although I stopped using it, I never thought the pains were due to it - I thought it was from going out right after the shower which I often do. That same night I woke up with hives appearing in my body and towards the end of the day, my face got swollen (eyes and my inner lip.) At first I thought it was a food allergy, went to the doctor and got a full blood test (White blood cells, red cells, cholesterol, sugar, full allergy, almost everything.)

During the waiting period of my results (took about a week and a half) I was taking steroid pills for allergies and I got back to normal within 5 days. On the 8th day, I was like hmm lets take minocycline again, I wanna be proactive and not break out on acne again. I took one pill at night after 8 days of not using it, and the next day I got itchy hands and a few hives and then I realized it was the minocycline that I was reacting to. Luckily I only took one pill and over the counter allergy medicine such as zyrtec got rid off my itchiness and I am back to normal again.

778	naproxen	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	nerve damage/ acdf surgery	Benefits of Naproxen helped with inflammation in the neck. Having a herniated disc the size of a plum impinged on a nerve for about a year and a half caused permanent nerve and muscle damage in the right arm. After surgery there was immediate relief however, because of the damage there are still issues with pain and inflammation. There are also still 2 bulging discs in the same area as the 2 herniated discs that were removed and replaced (i.e.) ACDF surgery.	At times there were stomach irritations as a result of Naproxen. It caused acid reflux to be moderate to severe at times. Taking with food helped and at other times it was necessary to take a medicine for the upset.	Treatment for inflammation in the cervical spine after ACDF surgery was necessary to remove 2 discs that were herniated and had a nerve severely impinged. As a result of nerve impingement there is permanent nerve damage and muscle damage. Almost 2 years after surgery still see doctor monthly for inflammation and pain. There are also 2 bulging discs that at this point and time have yet to cause any further surgery or pain.

197	adderall	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	This treatment was easy and highly effective. Adderall increased my overall energy levels, making it easier to get going in the morning and stay awake during classes. It increased my ability to pay attention even when the material was not particularly interesting to me. The most important benefit for me was the increased ability to control my impulses.	If taken too late in the day, it can interfere with sleep. It must be carefully controlled as it is addictive. The main side effect I have experienced though was pathological skin picking. I mainly pick at my legs, but the picking sometimes leaves small scars. It also decreases appetite, which means patients must learn new ways to remember to eat or to identify the need to eat. It can also increase blood pressure slightly.	"""Hi, I was tried to be put on Ritalin when I was 5 and it simply wasn&rsquo;t gonna happen w my parents.

I went to my internist and told him that I wanted to be put on a low dose of an antidepressant and something for my anxiety . I had been on Effexor for many years, awile ago. Effexor worked but the withdrawal symptoms were horrible, even if I so much as missed a dose. Perhaps it was a placebo effect, but I felt the Zoloft working after about a week. Nothing earth shattering,but noticeable.

Taken when needed from normal anxiety it just relaxes body and mind... it's long lasting nature often means that"	"Slight mental and phyical sedation (positive effect for me but be careful if you need to be alert e.g driving)

Slight mental fog for couple of hours on a higher dose (i wouldn't choose this particular benzodiazepine if I felt anxiety at work as I wouldn't be able to concentrate up to the standard required.) But perfect for every other situation."	"It's long lasting nature often means that if I am experiencing anxiety only one dose is enough to last through the night into the next day... and often it seems as though the body remembers and stores this relaxation so another dose is not necessary. 

I only take when needed which can mean I go months without a dose... this is important as for me personally if I see valium and other benzodiazepine drugs as a long term / life treatment its vital not to become addicted and dependant as this not only means needing a drug to function (shackled by a drug rather than using its benefits when really needed.)

But if your body has constant daily dosing for months or years your brain stopped producing natural relaxation chemicals meaning that you need more and more of the drug to get the same benefit and also because of this after years of high dosage extreme withdrawal symptoms can occur while the brain starts to produce these chemicals again."

At least four days after using Benzaclin I definitely started noticing results, my face cleared up dramatically. I would wash my face at night, put it wherever I had acne then sleep with it on.

I was extremely hyper, couldn't sit still, felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin.	"""After about a week of headaches and migraines with no relief despite taking every treatment I had available, I went to the ER. The doctor mentioned Reglan as a treatment option and I accepted. I got Reglan in an IV, and a few minutes later I just started to feel very anxious. Everything just felt very urgent and I felt very restless. My face also started to feel hot. I also was alone during this visit, which I&#039;m sure didn&#039;t help. I also suffer from anxiety, so it just increased my usual symptoms. My migraine relief was only so-so; it came back the next day. Reglan might be a good option for you if your migraine is really bad, but be careful because it can make you really anxious."""

After a month of taking this medication I saw a good result, my acne started to clear off within 2 months there were minimal acne, after 4 months no more acne, (just occasionally one or two popped up)  It worked well on by drying up my oil glands so my face were less oily and it helped fixing up my scars as well.	The visible side effects were dryness on my lips and throat.  So drinking more water is essential and occasionally applied some lip balm.  Other than that nothing that I felt or noticed of.  Other side effects were it may increase blood pressure and damage liver tissues if taking too long without doctor care.	Doctor prescribed 2 weeks of antibiotic to clear off my break out with some antibiotic cream and of course sun block, followed by roaccutane 20 mg for the first two months 1 capsule a day and after seeing a good result he advised me to maintain a low dose of one every other day for another eight months.

The Nausea and Vomiting would often last through the next day.	"All in all, it was effective, but not worth taking for the side effects.

Pleasant taste in the chewable.
318	ativan	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	inability to fall asleep	I was able to fall asleep and stay asleep.	None, until recently. I began having severe anxiety/panic attacks. I stopped the Lorazepam in order to determine the culprit, if any. No panic attacks since stopping the drug. Seems strange since this is the drug of choice for panic attacks.	Lorazepam was prescribed inability to fall asleep. Also, if needed during the day for anxiety. I never took it during the day for anxiety, only at night to aid in sleep.

I am very annoyed about the bad press surrounding use of Xanax as myself and others who have been prescribed the Medication can use it in a mature manner.Generally people of good judgement and living clean lifestyles are at little risk for addiction.Xanax was produced to help with specific problems possibly due to chemical inbalances in brain or traumas."
2125	renova	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	wrinkles	I used the product to try to reduce previous sun damage as well as discoloration and wrinkles created by aging (I'm currently 50).  I feel the product did even out my skin tone at least somewhat however did not remove the larger areas of discoloration due to sun damage.  Overall the condition of my skin did improve, however the effects were not as dramatic as hoped.  This may be due to the discontinuation of the 0.05% formulation which would of course be more potent that the 0.02% that I could get.  I will try Retin A next time around to go for the 0.05% and see if results improve further.	Treatment side effects were overall very minimal.  I had been told to expect a considerable amount or redness and perhaps flakiness.  This never occurred whatsoever and virtually no affects from application itself were noted.  The two items that were noted is that I was initially not aware you could not receive waxing while using Renova and had a burn resulting from an eyebrow wax.  I also did find, as stated, that I would burn much more easily in the sun.	My skin care program prior to Renova was wash with Cetaphil, tone with a Paula Begoun antioxidant toner, 8% glycolic acid gel, moisturizer.  Same in the evening.  After adding Renova, same routine in morning but in evening I went to:  Wash with Cetaplil, tone with same product as before, wait 30 minutes, apply Renova.  On alternate nights, I add a Skin Recovery Antioxidant about 30 minutes after the Renova.

Probably my problem was not severe enough to see the results, however, due to no observed change I stopped using it.	I have not noticed any side effects. Though I am susceptible to various allergies, I have not had any breakouts or worsening effects. Also, blackheads and acne did not become any worse.	"""Had the worst experience with this gel. I&#039;m not the type to suffer from side effects and I reacted badly to this. It burnt my skin and went red raw for at least 4/5 days. It was also very very dry.

While it did somewhat control my partial seizures, I was sick ALL THE TIME and had such severe headaches it sucked!
That was 8 yrs ago for about a year. 

This time around we decided to try it again with the Dilantin/Topamax combo to get rid of the partial seizures as the generalized seizures were licked. Smarter doctor got me on 150mg am/150mg pm for a total of 300mg a day.

2348	propecia	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	receding hairline	I did find new hairs coming in on my scalp, but only in the middle of my head where I wasn't losing any hair, but that is about it.	After taking this drug for about a half of a year, I decided that the side effects weren't worth feeling miserable...even if that means I was going to be bald.  The first month was okay, but after that I started having many emotional problems due to the hormone balance, I had difficulty receiving an erection, reaching orgasm, or being aroused in any way.  My relationship with my girlfriend suffered greatly. My testicles constantly ached and some days it was hard to concentrate on anything else because I was so uncomfortable.  After being off this medication for a few weeks now, I feel so much better.  Just a few days after I took my last pill I could tell a huge difference in the way I was feeling.  I would never take this medication again.  I believe this company should look at the side effects more and re-evaluate the statistics that they originally advertised.  It says that only about 1% of men experience any problems that I listed above...and it seems like I have read more negative reviews than positive.	1 mg/day
1614	avage	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dark spots	I didn't notice dramatic results with this product and it was fairly expensive at $100 for one tube. I wasn't religious about applying it each day, so that might have had an impact on the effectiveness. I didn't notice significant fading of the darkest large freckles on my face as I had hoped. I didn't notice any significant reduction in wrinkles.	I did not experience any burning sensations with this product in the first week or there after. The product did make my face peel significantly the following day and this occured even with the use of an exfoliating facial wash each morning.	I applied the product to my face in the morning OR evening and did it in combination with other typical facial sunscreen products and mosterizers. Since the product was expensive and made my face peel, I tended to apply it only on the dark freckles I was trying to fade.
1178	prozac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Lessening of suicidal ideation and an increased ability to complete daily life tasks.	There was a decreased ability to have orgasms and a general numbing not quite stupor in which I existed. There was also a major decrese in appetite.	This drug resulted in an unanticipated weightloss of over 20lbs - I went from 128 to 108 lbs. The weight loss decresed the incidences of bulimia. The drug was effective in that I no longer felt depressed per se, but then I didn't feel much of anything. Any combination with alcohol should be avioded - majorly increases its effects!
1904	doxycycline	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	My acne did heal. I took it consistently for about 2 months and my acne healed up and my skin looked really good after a long time, but when I forgot to refill it, I started breaking out again. So after taking it again for a couple of weeks my skin started to clear up. I have not taken Doxycline for a few months now and my skin is doing good, besides the occasional break out.	The side affects were almost unbearable but I was determined to get clear skin so went through with it. There are many rules to taking it, such as on an empty stomach, no lying down after taking it, 2 hours before or after antacids, iron or vitamins/minerals. You must take it on an empty stomach so the it absorbs more efficiently and works effectively, But it is painful. I would feel extremely nauseous with a really bad stomach ache. Sometimes when I was in the sun my skin was more sensitive.	I had really bad almost like nodular acne . I visited with my dermatologist who gave me the option of taking Accutane or Doxycycline and i decided to to go with Doxycycline since Accutane had a considerable amount of side affects.
342	neurontin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	Reduced pain in legs and forearms, and blocked the pain from the arthritis in my lower back.  The pain in my legs from the RLS is considerably lessoned.  I also was in chronic pain from my arthritis, but can now move around without any pain, (unless I lift or do any type of work that is strenuous), but I used to be in so much pain that I would cry, so it was definitely worth it for me to take Neurontin.	None.	Three 600 mg. tabs in the a.m. and three 600 mg. tabs at bedtime.
1735	topamax	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine prevention	Topamax helped decrease the frequency and intensity of my migraines.	Treatment side effects include paresthesia of my hands and mild drowsiness.	Topamax was taken in order to prevent migraines. I also monitored my diet to avoid migraine triggers such as caffeine, aged cheeses, preserved meats, bananas, avocados, beans, dairy products, beer, wine, etc. In addition, I took birth control pills to control hormonal fluctuations. This helped prevent menstrual migraines.

After trying many other drugs the patient was prescribed protonix and it worked very effectively.  The patient was then able to eat regular meals with no ill effects.	None.  There didn't appear to be any side effects to taking this prescription.  The one drawback was that it took time to dissolve and frequently there was discomfit prior to it dissolving.

1620	premarin	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hot flashes / night sweats	The Premarin did reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats.  From that perspective, the drug was somewhat effective.  However, the side effects were devastating and worse than dealing with the menopausal symptoms.  It took me two years to discern that the problems I encountered were attributable directly to the Premarin.	I developed strange lesions on my arms, which were sore and very embarrassing.  I could not wear short-sleeved shirts, because of the mess my arms had become.  Obviously, I showed them to the doctor; he simply shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't have a clue what might be causing the lesions.  When I went off the Premarin, on my own volition, the lesions disappeared to a significant degree.  When I added proteolytic enzymes and hydrochloric acid to my diet, the lesions disappeared completely.  I am now able to use bioidentical hormone replacement therapy with complete success and no side effects whatsoever.	"The doctor put me on the maximum dosage because I was ""young"" for menopause.  Did not test estrogen levels either before beginning treatment or after starting the HRT.  I simply took one Premarin pill per day, every day."

Morning anxiety ++	30mg daily oxazepam 30 prn x3 max
2407	synthroid	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypothyroidism	This dosage was supposed to help the thyroid function correctly. However, it appeared to make me more lethargic, even though the blood test showed that it was working correctly. I experienced more benefit from exercise than from taking this mandatory drug.	I experienced weight gain fluctuations and loss of energy. I complained to several doctors over the period of 20 years without effect. There is no alternative treatment if the patient does not feel the benefit. The doctor only sees the blood test to show that the treatment is effective.	No treatment, other than taking a blood test every 6 months to see if the level was correct, regardless of the side effects. I found this offensive since I clearly gained 20 pounds when on the medication than when I was not on the medication (or the dosage was reduced).
4086	mobic	3	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	bursitis	I did not notice any benefits in terms of decrease of pain or inflammation in the affected site.  I've found fish oil and curcumin to be far more effective with fewer side effects.	Personally, I noticed an increase in constipation as a result of taking this medication.  I also saw an increased incidence of heart burn during that period.	I was experiencing inflammation in my hip after surgery.  Mobic was prescribed to deal with the inflammation, but I didn't notice any strong positive effects.

Prescribed by my psychiatrist to use in various doses over several years of use to use for anxiety and panic, and in conjunction with Klonopin as an effective measure to reduce a mixed/manic episode of bipolar disorder in an acute situation, and also at a low-level dose every day to reduce the chance of episodes from occuring.

Also it GREATLY reduced my cramps.  And, to this day, I am not pregnant :)  The benefits of this ""pill"" were far greater than any others I have tried, and I have tried several different brands."	The treatment side effects were minimal.  In fact I can't think of any.  I have tried many different types of the pill where it had side effects on my face, barely reduced cramps, however this one didn't have any of those side effects and I continue to use it.	it was one pill a day, as any birth control pill is usually taken.  I took them properly and that is probably one reason why the benefits were great.  However I took the other brands at the right time to and they didn't work as well.
1992	vicodin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	post surgery stomach pain	The pain subsided very quickly with no side effects.	none.	After a surgery to remove ovarian cysts, I was left with pain in my stomach and lower back.  The Hydrocodone/acetaminophen pills were prescribed and were very effective in getting rid of the pain, with no side effects.
3114	ortho-tri-cyclen	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pregnancy prevention	Benefits were the prevention of pregnancy, regular periods, shorter periods, and less intense pms symptoms.  My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period.	For the first month of taking ortho tri cyclen i was a little moody.  When my period started the first month i was very moody but that only lasted about 3 days.  The second month of my period my pms calmed down and now i have no mood swings and only one day of cramps.

Was having a weight issue, and with a blood test it was determined that the thyroid gland was ""sluggish"".  I was very exhausted also and it has helped somewhat with fatigue."	dosing is extremely important as it takes many blood tests to determine correct dosage.  Not having the dosage quite right will basically result in the same symptoms that you are having issues with.  I have suffered basically no significant side effects other than that.	Pill is taken early in the morning on an empty stomach.  It is basically prescription iodine as hypothyroidism is basically an iodine deficiency.  Symptoms that I experienced were basically weight gain and extreme fatigue.  It's taken awhile to get the dosage correct, and after switching pharmacies and getting a different drug manufactured by another company, I feel that maybe another blood test is necessary to confirm that the new pills are as effective as the others I had been taking for 5 years.
3015	cipro	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	uti	I was able do my work without hassles and I'm free from pain right now. There's no need for me to cry anymore whenever I urinate.

1455	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	situational atypical depression	Cymbalta takes effect quickly -- within days, as opposed to weeks -- and relieves one's sense of hopelessness, futility and fatigue during a deep depression. At higher doses, a sense of purpose and direction to one's life was also restored, allowing the patient (in this case, me) to exercise better judgment and effective follow through on plans and decisions.	I haven't noticed any overt side-effects. For me this medication has been extremely effective and very easy to use.	Two 60 mg. capsules first thing in the morning.
2976	strattera	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	Stratterra enabled me to concentrate and focus on tasks at hand.  It makes a world of difference in my daily life.  After four years of using Stratterra, I would never switch to a different ADHD medication.	Stratterra surpresses my appetite and makes me feel quite dependent on the drug to function. If I take with my multivitamin, I often feel nauseous.	I take 1 60 mg of Stratterra in the morning daily.
2285	lexapro	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Before I started on the drug Lexapro, I felt lethargic and didn't want to get out of bed each morning. I hated getting up and facing the day. I would sit and watch the time pass by. Finally, I went to my Dr. for a checkup and he diagnosed me as being depressed. He put me on Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg. I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday. For the first week I felt disconnected from myself but by the 2nd week I started to feel as if each morning was something to look forward to. I believe that Lexapro was a great addition to my life during my troubled times.	In the first week of treatment I felt disconnected from myself. I felt fuzzy and had trouble thinking clearly. It was this side effect that made me not want to take the drug anymore but I continued taking it 2 times per day. By the second week the fuzziness began to lift and I felt more like my normal self. After 2 months of taking Lexapro I felt like I was back to my old self again.	Lexapro was taken 2 times a day for 2 months.
1448	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Daily anxiety lessened considerably. When stressful situations arise I am better able to handle them although I am still able to feel somewhat anxious which is good. I don't want to be a zombie with no feelings at all.	There is a possibility of elevated blood pressure but my medication for the blood pressure seems to be doing the job.	I just take 1 pill daily.
266	ultram	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	knee pain	Eased the leg pain.  I had full range of motion in knee.	slight muscle spasms, euphoria	"""I fell at work on my knees and have had severe pain ever since.  I have been using 50 mg Ultram (Tramadol) for about 3 months and I can honestly say that I am able to function at work and during my daily life.  I have been on hydrocodone and Lortab and both of these medicines make me sleepy and just out of it all day. Ultram helps me quite well but after 5-6 hours I am ready to take another one.  Dosage is 3 times per day/every 6-8 hours.  My family is happy and so am I.  I would recommend this medicine, it truly works."""
1932	zithromax	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	strep throat	Strep symptoms subsided w/in 3 days. Reinfection did not occur. Family members did not catch the infection.	No side affects were experienced.  Yogurt intake was increased to aleviate potential of thrush from antibiotic usage.	"""Very good response. It is so useful for me. """
2698	detrol-la	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bladder pressure	For the most part, the pressure feeling I constantly had in my bladder went away.  Sometimes, especially in the middle of the night, the pressure would return slightly.  Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night, I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night.	I would wake up with a very hoarse voice.  Usually, the hoarsness would disappear during the day, but sometimes my voice would crack when I spoke.  Also, your throat is dry and irratated.  It's almost like you feel like you're getting a bad sore throat but it never quite turns into one.  My mouth was a little dry, but hardly noticable.	I was prescribed it after a bladder infection, which was cleared up, lead to a pressure feeling in my bladder.  I take the medicine once a day.  I guess the medicine is slow releasing but once in a while I felt like I should take a dose earlier than prescribed.  I am also scheduled for physical therapy on the muscles of my bladder wall, but have not started them yet.  I did this kind of therapy 10 years ago when my bladder had this same pressure feeling and the therapy did help--I'm looking forward to starting it and hopefully getting off the medication.
3965	prilosec	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	heartburn	stopped the heartburn	impossible to get off of them after a period of time....if you stop after years (I started on them when they first came out) your throat will feel like it is being ripped with a knife and you will eventually take them again (trust me...I stopped opiates cold turkey...but not these)	"""This medicine did not work for me at all.  Even with dietary changes I would have occasional flare ups."""
754	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	chronic sinusitis	The medication is much cheaper than the other prescription medications like it and works very well.	None that I have noticed, but if I skip a day or two I experience mild congestion.	I had chronic sinus infections due to inflammation and allergies. This medication has worked pretty good and is an alternatice to sinus surgery. If your doctor prescribes a more expensive form of this drug(Nasacort AQ), ask them to let you try Flonase first. It worked for me.
2541	lamisil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	toenail fungus	I just finished my 90 day course and am seeing great benefits.  My toenails are finally growing out thin and clear.  I didn't start to see any major changes in my toenails until around the two month mark.  I told myself I would be one of the people who comes back to review the product because the positive reviews I read are what got me through those first few weeks when all of the negative side effects were flashing through my head.  It has definitely been worth it to take the pills.  I can't wait for a few more months to go by where my toenails will be completely  be grown out and I will feel confident about going and getting the first pedicure of my life.  Also very much looking forward to sandal season next year.	For the first few days I definitely had some diarrhea but it wasn't that bad.  Maybe some mild stomach cramping within that period too.  But I ate some yogurt with it before I took it at bedtime which helped curb any intestinal issues.  All of this went away within a week or two of taking it.  I also experienced some cotton mouth feeling and that lasted pretty much the whole time.  It wasn't too bad but noticeable.  I never had any taste disturbances.	I took one pill a day, at night for 90 days with a big glass of water and never skipped a dose.  I had a few nights where I had some wine and champagne but never overdid it and tried to steer clear of alcohol as much as possible.
3256	imuran	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	crohn's disease	I could completelly leave the corticosteroids and didn't feel the pain and inflamation except for some special periods of stress. Consequently I got a better quality of life.	I have not detected any side effects but the analysis I take every six months show that the amount of white blood except for a very low decrease of white cells and anemia.	"""Our son was very sick for a year before being diagnosed with Crohns Disease, at his worst he was 62 lbs and 12 years old! The poor sweet thing was withering away to nothing! Every bone in his body stuck out It was a terrible time for the entire family to see such a sweet soul struggle so badly.

We are so thankful for this prescription!"""
1341	tegretol	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	neuropathic pain	There was no benefit for either my neuropathic pain or migraine headaches.	I had massive weight gain.  Ten pounds the first month, ten pounds the second month, five pounds the third month and five pounds the fourth month.  The weight gain totaled forty pounds. Almost fifteen years later, despite the same healthy diet & exercise that kept me at a healthy weight before,  the extra forty pounds of weight is still there. It also made me very tired.	"""I have trigeminal neuralgia and have been suffering from it for quite some time. I was put on 300 mgs twice a day and it didn&#039;t help at all and the attacks were just getting more severe and frequent, so the neurologist upped it to 900mgs a day. Still no relief!

Now when I wake up in the morning my eyes are not that swollen. Also my heart seems to work without much effort. Before I felt my heart pumping hard and now I can't hardly feel it.	None that I can tell.	"""I have been taking this medication for about 2 weeks now. It has lowered my blood pressure tremendously, but the side effects are great for me. I am so tired ALL day. This is very unusual for me because I do not sleep during the day. I have found myself laying down about 11am for a nap and not waking up until 4 or 5 pm. Not like me at all."""
1222	prozac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Perfect.  The Trazadone helps me sleep inspite of the Prozac.  I no longer have any manic phases thanks to Lamictal.		I started with the Prozac.  Then the trazadone was added to help me sleep.  I was always cycling into manic phases but they became more extreme and serious.  The Lamictal completely obliterated the mania.  I feel completely stable, happy and am very high functioning.

3498	maxalt	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Relief of migraine headache with in one hour and it stays away for 24 - 48 hours.  Migraines have been part of my life since I was 19.  This is the only medication that relieves my headaches so that I can function in my work and family life.	Funny feeling in throat for about 2 hours after I take it and also my skin is sensitive to hot water for about 12 hours after I take it.	I have been taking Maxalt for years.  I have had one sided migraines for years.  They have always lasted 3 days of excrutiating pain.  Maxalt has been a life saver.  I take it at the onset of headache and have complete relief in one hour.  Unfortunately there was a time when i was taking this daily, which was a pain regarding insurance coverage.  However in the last year I have learned a couple physicial techniques to minimize the frequency of headaches, but I still take Maxalt 1-2x per week.  Every time it is 100% effective.
3068	oxycodone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	metastasized ovarian cancer/chemotherapy	One year after diagnosis, surgery and beginning chemotherapy for stage IIIc ovarian cancer, I am working 35+ hours per week and living more or less normally while receiving biweekly chemotherapy treatments.  Taking oxycodone makes all the difference in my quality of life, because it allows me to live without otherwise constant pain in my back, ribcage and belly.  In the absence of this pain, my mobility/activity level is excellent, I can think and focus clearly, and I am free of the depression and frustration of what could be a debilitating illness.	Occasional fogginess if otherwise fatigued; otherwise, I am surprised at the absence of noticeable side effects.	As I am aware of the addictive potential of narcotics/opioids, I have deliberately requested a continued low dose (5 mg) and have made a point of not increasing frequency to more than three tablets a day.  During the week after chemo, I will sometimes experience a bit of breakthrough pain between doses, and will then take a low (325 mg) dose of acetaminophen.
2454	ecotrin	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	headache	Pain and pressure in front temporal lobes was reduced 50% within 2 hours of initial treament. Within 4 hours an overall 80% reduction in symptom severity.	No side effects were noticed over a 72 hour period following initial treament taken in the evening.	One 325 mg tablet taken with 12 oz glass of water in evening.
3745	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	mood stabilization	The wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  With just the two antidepressants I could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  But the lamictal prevented me from going down.  I have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and I have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  The doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis I had received (dysthimia) may have been wrong and really I was a manic-depressive (which I am not).  Apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  This is what I thought was implied.  Boy have I been glad that someone came up with lamical.	There were no side effects.  If there were,(which I don't think there were) then they were so minimal as to go unnoticable by me. Some people say they are the type that has all the side effects. I seem to be the one that has none of the side effects.	The treatment has been 200mg/day for three years.
3984	fosamax	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	osteoporosis	"Fosamax tended to hold the line, i.e., my bone density did not progress rapidly.
It never increased the density.  The density decreased gradually."	Some stomach discomfort.	"""When I first started this there were little, small side effects. I figured over time I would get used to the side effects and thus deal with them. Instead the side effects became intolerable. I would test the med by taking it while I was feeling well. I still had several side effects. Finally the last time I took this the side effects me sick for two full days. Terrible upset stomach, extreme gas and bloating. Worse aches and pains, unable to sleep even with sleep medication. The verge of vomiting at any moment, very dizzy. Extreme bone pain. Several other situations happened with the last dose."""
412	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migrain	As soon as I felt a migraine coming on, I would feel very tired and feel dizzy at first and then the headache would come a little later. As soon as I could feel the headache I would take one tablet and within half an hour to an hour the headache would go and I would feel a lot better but still a little odd, a not quite 'here' feeling	I don't think I have any side effects as such but I usually feel a little odd and very tired after a migraine but not sure if that is the after effects of the migraine or a side effect of taking Imigran. Before I was given these by my doctor my migrains lasted for 3 days with severe headache and nausea.	My doctor told me to take one as you feel a migraine coming on, if it does not work it is not worth taking another one but this rarely happens. If the headache goes but comes back I can take another one, I tend to do this if the attack is servere, I might need to take two or even three over two or three days but generally I find one tablets works. I have been taking it for approx 10 years or so.
1813	humira	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	The joint pain becomes considerably less within 24 hours of the shot.  I have more energy and almost no more nausea.

Viral load check every 3 months together with ALT, AST and complete blood count.

At first I didn't realize that it was significantly converting to DHT and causing typical male pattern hairloss.    Once I realized it was happening, I was able to slow it down greatly via a shampoo designed to block DHT (not systematically, just on the scalp).	"""I&#039;m 20 years old, 6 months ago I did two testosterone tests and it was below 20mg yeah 20 mg.

2138	concerta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	I did not have any other conditions.  Just an inability to focus, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior.  I had a hard time staying organized and difficulty completing tasks.  I also had difficulty staying with one job for too long.  I had a hard time sustaining reading without getting really tired, and I also had a hard time controlling my emotional outbursts.  The  Concerta really helped me control all of those things.	Some of the side affects that I had were:  my stomach would hurt sometimes and other times it was difficult to eat without getting queezy.  I didn't have much of an appetite.  When the medicine wore off, it seemed to have a strong rebound effect and things became difficult for me during that last several hours of my day. I liked taking the medication, I just wish it would have lasted longer during the day.  By 3p-5pm it had wore off and that seemed to by my busiest time of day with the kids, dinner and house stuff all at once.	The treatment details were pretty basic.  I just took the medication in the morning at the same time of day every day.  I was allowed to skip it on the weekends or less busy times if I so desired.  I really don't have anything else to put for this section of the survey.  I'm trying to fill up the 50 word requirement though.  You shouldn't really have that requirement on this form.  It seems kind of silly to be writing with nothing left to say.

3295	zoloft	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 

Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them."	"The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.

Other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions."	"My primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, Zoloft. The plan was to take the medication for three to six months until I felt I was back on track and could maintain a functional lifestyle without it. 

I started with 25 mg every other day for five days, then 25 mg a day for one week, followed by 50 mg a day every day thereafter. I began therapy with a psychologist once a week where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Strangely enough, I found the counseling to do more harm than good in this case partially because it made me see my childhood for what it really was. I did not find that to be helpful at the time. Had I not been on anti-depressants before I went to counseling, I would have needed it afterward to deal with the emotional blows that I had to face and could no longer ignore that drove me into depression in the first place."

The side effect that I noticed was EXTENSIVE bruising wherever the skin is struck or bumped into something.	After taking this drug for about a month and a half, I fell down some cement stairs quite dramatically.  The next day I was sore, as can be expected.  But I also had HUGE bruises in the spots where I guess I made the most contact or the most severe impact.  (I'm lucky I didn't crack my head open or break something!)One bruise was about 6 inches by 6 inches.

1513	lotrel	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	There was a huge reduction in the number of migraine headaches that I experienced.  Before I started on the meds, I was getting migraines 3-4 times per week.  Now I get them once or twice a year.  I think the daily meds may even slightly reduce the rate at which a migraine (the rare times that I get them now) comes on.	I do experience a slight cough.  It isn't a major problem; it only happens maybe a couple times a week and it is sort of like a cough you would use to clear a tickle from your throat.	"""I&#039;m a 58 year old male having been on Lotrel 10-20mg for several years now.  I have not had any side effects, with this medication and have seen it is controlling my high blood pressure."""
2673	prinivil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	It lowered my blood pressure from borderline high (140/90) to normal (about 120/75).  This treatment worked most of the time.  THe only time it did not work as well was when I was ill or was having asthma related problems (difficulty breathing).  During those times, even with the lisinopril, my blood pressure went up to the pre-treatment level.	For over a year after starting the treatment I believe I had a side effect of a dry cough that was probably caused by this drug.  It was unclear whether or not it truly was caused by the lisinopril because the coughing did not stop when I temporarily halted treatment (for a few days).  When the coughing was at it's worst, my blood pressure went up, nullifying the effect of the linsinopril.	In spite of the irritating coughing, I continued taking the linsinopril and after numerous tests to rule out other causes of the coughing (one Dr. thought it was because of acid reflux), the coughing finally subsided.  After about a year of coughing, the coughing finally subsided and now (5-7 years later) I don't have any coughing whatsoever attributable to the lisinopril.

1151	byetta	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	obesity and diabetes	I initially had severe cramping and nausea, but I continued under doctor's orders, I only lost about 20 pounds, tops.  I now have a larger host of problems I believe were started with this medication.  I have not used in 3 years.	Severe cramping, headaches, incredible nausea, muscle cramps, vomiting blood (not once but on 2 occasions due to doctor's orders).  I now am facing something wrong with my digestive tract and no doctor has been able to figure out what is wrong.  Since this is the area where the medication was injected, and only there, I believe that the byetta is the perfect suspect.  Now, if I could only find a doctor that will listen to me.  The count is 5 and still increasing.  Recently, I lost 4 pounds in 3 days!!!!  This is not normal!	I was to inject the said amount into the abdominal (below the waist, above the pelvic bone) before breakfast and lunch.  The amount was changed when the medical professional I was having treat me decided to increase the dosage, and with terrible results (I was vomiting blood and could not eat or even drink water - I couldn't even stand the smell of food).

They cut my gums and pulled them down further over the teeth and added a laboratory grown skin product to make the gum larger.  I also used this periogard bottle when they put caps on my teeth, just to prevent infection.	I had no side effects, but was told the product could stain the teeth (which the dentist could alter back to white teeth), however, I wiped my teeth with a wash cloth after swishing with the product.	"""I have had Gingivitis and very deep pockets for quite some time now. My gums would bleed when I flossed, brushed and used my water pick. Nothing I did worked. I had gum surgery also and the bleeding continued. On a visit to my Dentist I was given Periogard to try and within 10 days of using this product the bleeding completely stopped. I was amazed to see how this product worked to kill the germs that cause my Gingivitis. I do have some tooth staining but I can live with that. My teeth feel much better and the taste of blood from bleeding is gone. Saying I&#039;m very happy with Periogard would be an understatement. For me Periogard is my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I just wish my dentist recommended this to me sooner."""

Never had any crazy dreams or sleep-walking episodes. Worked great as a sleep aid.	Sometimes felt a little tired in morning, sometimes groggy. But nothing a latte can't fix.	"""Works very well for anxiety. The best way to take these types of medicines is to take them as needed. Some doctors will tell you to take them everyday as prescribed, but I found in my 20 years of experience with Xanax that taking them everyday is an easy way for it to become habit forming and addictive. When I take them as needed I don&#039;t become dependent on them. I think doctors disagree with this method because they feel that you need to counter the anxiety before you get it and that way you can learn to tolerate it. I have tried using Xanax both ways, it&#039;s nice not having anxiety, but your body and mind will adapt to the dosage and if you take it long enough you will find you need a higher dose to feel like you did."""
1568	lortab	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	oral surgery	considerably reduced pain, if i experienced any at all.	With two tablets, the main difference was moderate to severe drowsiness. With either dosage, I experienced vibrant dreams/nightmares and/or an elated/lightheaded feeling while awake. Constipation relieved with extra fiber.	In my experience with this medication, I've found it moderately addicting and should be taken with caution. I advise to take when in mild-moderate pain because that's what it's for, but hold off taking it every six hours (or as prescribed) if pain is not an issue.

3611	retin-a	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	whiteheads	After using the Retin A for several months I did notice a decrease in the amount of whiteheads on my checks. My skin seemed to appear brighter and my complexion was not as splotchy. While I did not get any more whiteheads, it did not completely remove the ones I had.	The worst side effect was the burning sensation I experienced during the first few weeks. The area that was affected was around my mouth. I started to put less in that area and the burning cessation decreased. I had some minor flaking, but not a lot.	I put the cream on every night for 8 months. My dermatologist told me that the Retin A should help to unclog my pores. By continuing the Retina A I just sgould not have any new whitheads form.
1392	mercaptopurine	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	crohn's disease	I was prescribed the drug Mercaptopurine after two previous treatment drugs had begun to prove less effective than before.  The doctor started on a higher course of the medicine, but the dose is currently 100mg (2 pills) every evening.  There was a significant reduction in Crohn's disease symptoms, particularly general intestinal cramping.  This was particularly helpful for cramping that tended to occur as I was relaxing to go to sleep.	Though the Crohn's disease in itself makes me tired, and I feel that the addition of the Mercaptopurine has added to my general fatigue.  The fatigue abated somewhat as the dose was lowered (the doctor started at a more aggressive dose).  I also seem to catch every bug that is going around.  By suppressing my immune system I believe the Mercaptopurine makes it easier for seasonal illnesses to set up shop.	"""This medication was very effective for all my Crohn&#039;s symptoms (including lack of energy, nausea, bleeding, etc..). It is like night vs. day being on this medication and being off of it."""

Protonix was prescribed to me in combination with Domperidone to reduce bloating, belching, and an acid-burning sensation in the stomach.	"None, really, that I can specifically blame on this drug. I had actually reacted fairly badly to other, similar drugs. The famous ""purple pill"" Nexium had actually given me a brutal headache, sore-throat, and even a racing heart-beat at times.

3780	metronidazole	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bacterial lung infection	I was not able to take the drug long enough to know its benefits.	I took my first dose before bed one night.  In the morning I woke with a cold sore and a very large ulcer on my tongue.  I attributed this to the slight fever I had been running periodically.  My tongue became increasingly sore.  The second pill, later on that day, caused sever stomach pain, cramping, diarhea, nausea, and hot flashes.  The oral pain remained about the same. I took the third, and last, dose that afternoon is the worst experience I have ever had with a drug.  Immediately after taking the pill blisters began to appear wherever the pill had touched my skin.  This included the entirety of my tongue, mouth, lips, and throat.  I called the PA that had prescribed the drug and told her about the reaction.  She told me to discontinue the drug immediately and that was a possible side effect of this drug.  Had I any idea what it was going to be like, and the intense pain I would endure because of it, thenI would never have taken it.	I took 3 pills.  That is all.

- better mood (because of less pain)"	The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few.

The problem is the drug company and Walgreens try to convince people these side effects and sudden drastic changes in the way the pills work are in the head of the patient and bully them into fearing looking like a drug seeker.

2289	lexapro	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	happier, slept better. The Lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the Trazadone with sleep. Together they worked quite well, I thought, as I was peppier during the day and slept well at night. So all in all, I would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. I felt cured	groggy sometimes. And I could not really stop, though I was able to play with the amount of the trazodone, lowering it down to 50 mg. whenever ever I could. I did not notice side effects from Lexapro, just perhaps that I became flat overtime--not depressed but no super excited either. So at a certain point, I wanted to get off. I had wonderful dreams on trazodone, but would sometimes go back to sleep in the morning for 1-3 extra hours.	50-150 mg of trazodone and 20 mg of lexapro daily. I took all at night, just before going to bed. I would when trying to bring the Trazodone down--so I would be less groggy in the morning-- go very slowly, 25 mg less every few days. Usually this would work. If I woke in the middle of the night, I would immediately get up and take another 50 mg. I have probably taken up to 250 mg in one night, but very rarely. And I have had long periods where I was at 50 mg, only taking more if I was really stressed out or my mind was buzzling with too many details. I recommend this combination really.

I have never seen such a bad diaper rash on either of my babies. I took her in on the 3rd day of treatment and had the medication changed and both of her rashes went away in two days. The rash on her body looked like round welts and they were very itchy. They spread very fast starting as a ring around her whole waist, around her chest and behind her ears. It was blistered.  It also looked like round mosquito bites the size of a dime on her arms and legs. They also lost their appetite.	This was to treat an ear infection in both ears. The side effects from this medication were way worse than the ear infestion itself. It was extrememly scary to see how this medicine took hold of my 1 year old daughter's body. My son who is 2 was perscribed this medication on Friday due to a bronchial virus, he was also given a shot of antibiotics and given a cough suppressent. The augmenton did not give him the skin rash but he has a horrible diaper rash and it is extremely painful. He is not sleeping very well either and also has diarrhea. He was percribed the medicine on Friday and I didn't realize it was the same medication my daughter had two weeks ago. I will be calling my doctor this morning to explore other options of medication to get him better. This augmenton is bad for my babies. I hope it helps other people. The side effects have definately out weighed the benefits of helping my children heal. I am dissapointed. It is tough thinking you are giving your kids something that will help them and then they are in more pain than before you sought medical care.

I have been on it for two months and am still improving.	During the second week I experienced stomach problems.  I had diarrhea that lasted for about a week.  I also had moderate headaches which lasted a little longer than the stomach issues.	I went to the doctor due to problems associated with my depression.  I had been taking Wellbutrin but it seemed to be losing its effect.  The doctor recommended adding another antidepressant to boost the Wellbutrin.  I attempted three other anti-depressants but had severe side effects. Zoloft, Lexapro, and Celexa all caused me to have severe diarrhea.  During the four weeks that I stayed with Zoloft I experienced little improvement and lost 15 pounds as a result of the diarrhea and lack of appetite.

It has also made it possible for me to get some sleep at night without waking constantly in pain.

I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression.

I took the pills for around two years then heard on the news that many anti-depressants were no more effective than placebo. I decided to stop taking them, I weaned myself off over a few weeks. After this time I was a new person, the world felt real again, I was no longer plodding through life in a daze, I was so much happier, the things I used to enjoy I started to enjoy again. I am extremely angry that I cannot get back those years that I was taking various anti-depressants that turned me into a zombie who did not care about anything or anyone. I understand everyone is different and these may work for some people, but for me these drugs ruined my life, if you are taking them you could be missing out on so much, please consider whether they are doing more harm than good!

My body responded immediately.
2411	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	underactive thyroid	The treatment benefits were to counteract underactive thyroid conditions. Specifically, it kept my metabolism from being too slow, which meant that it diminished face swelling, kept my skin and hair from becoming dry, and from me feeling unusually cold and tired.

2572	klonopin	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	tia type seizures, stress	None.  I went from 140lbs down to 98lbs.  I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.	I do not know that all side effects were attributable to the Clonozapam alone or a combination of one or all drugs.  I did take just the Clonozapm and Lovastatin the first year.   Regardless, everytime I looked up a symptom on the web, it always pointed to MS.  My Neurologist did say we should investigate it, but we never did.  Anyway, I could not sleep for days on end, I had excessive hand tremors, voice tremors, unsteady gait, tintinnitus, eyesight problems, urinary problems, memory problems and a bunch more I can't even recall at the moment.  I weaned myself off the medicine in 3 months time and am very much improved but only after months and possibly years of being removed from all the problems.  I'd like to mention that at one point in time I took the cholesterol drug that Dr. Jarvis promotes...I can't remember the name and had to quit within the first week as it gave me pains in the front of my thighs that could take your breath away.  I know for a fact that that symptom was in fact attributable to that drug.  A good effect that came from that drug though was the almost immediate shrinkage of my breast cysts...I had many on both sides.  Upon starting on that drug, I could actually feel them draining, dissapating or whatever you might call it.  They have not returned, so I am very thankful for that aspect of the drug.  Because of the leg pain though, I found it intolerable.	I am not sure what you mean as I already told you that I was being treated for TIA like seizures with the Clonozapam and Aggrenox as a blood thinner for the same.  I also took Lovastatin for High Cholesterol.  In the course of all these medications I ended up getting a divorce.  The drugs did not lower my cholesterol... they made me more nervous and made me question what on earth was wrong with me?  I now weigh more than I ever have, and I started to gain wieght almost immediately after getting off of the drugs.  I could use to lose 20lbs, but I am not worried about it as I am so much healthier than I was during the time I was on all of the drugs.  I hope this has helped you in some way.  I am sorry that I can't be more specific, but I am in a hurry to put all of that behind me and build a healthier - drug free future.  I am very much a proponent of natural medicines these days!

Treatment included medication 2 times a day.  Instructions were to keep the area around the cold sore clean and to not touch the cold sore directly with hands.   This would ensure the spread of the cold sores was minimized.
4047	amoxil	10	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	infection from grazing an ankle on coral	"I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours."	The drug upset my stomach mildly. Otherwise no side effects noticed.	"I was given a 3 day prescription which is the reason I am submitting this report. 
I believe antibiotics should be prescribed in a course of 7 - 10 days. 
This practice as far as I know was very popular in Hong Kong and it still might be general practice.
In my case I did not want to return to the doctors office and be charged again for another consultation + purchase additional amoxilin as I was not covered by medical insurance at that time.
Instead I went to a local pharmacy with the package of antibiotics I received from the doctors office and asked if I could buy 12 tablets. They were more than happy to sell them to me (at a fraction of the cost I paid at the doctors office) and I followed through with a 7 day course.
The results were very positive and within 24 hours I could feel relief and I knew that the infection was being affected by the amoxilin. By the 3rd day the swelling was greatly reduced and other than a nasty wound on my ankle bone I felt very good. I continued the remaining 4 days and besides a scar on my ankle at the site of the infection I completely recovered."

I was able to focus a LITTLE bit better	Blurry vision, increased bladder leaks,moodiness, a little weight gain which may not be from Strattera	"Unfortunately I had a doctor who was uneducated about ADD and was very uncomfortable prescribing any medications for it. She put me on 10mg first.After 3-4 weeks I went back and asked for her to increase it. She prescribed 20mg,(which I found they don't make 20mg doses) Instead of changing it to a proper mg, she decided to have me take 2 10mg pills every morning which also doubled the cost and that amount was not enough to have much benefit. After about a year , I was finally prescribed a therapeutic dosage of 40mg. I had too many problems with the pharmacy ordering the right amount ( they had me take 4 10mg pills a day because they didn't order the right ones! I have no health insurance so was getting it on some program that made it cost me $6 but when they would screw up the order , I would either run out or have to get the full amount which was $130.00 at the 10mgs, so X 2 for 20mg, x 4 for 40mgs!! Just because of the way the pharmacy was doing it.Scamming the federal programs or  something...so I finally just quit taking it. I definately had noticed that it made pee without barely any warning, and my eyesight got alot worse, and my fiance said it made me ""mean"". All that has stopped now that I am not on it. But my ADD is back full force!"

None that I am aware of.	It took some trial and error to find the right combination of drugs to treat my hypothyroid, but once we started the combo of levothyroxine and cytomel, my tests show that everything is under control.  I take the one pill of each one first thing in the morning with lots of water before eating anything.  I have to wait 30 minutes before I eat breakfast.  The hardest part is that I have to wait 2 hours before I take any calcium pills, which means I often forget to take my calcium.

Cramps associated with diarrhea have disappeared. Increased energy, feeling active and generally feeling better.  Endoscopy was done at one point after the treatment and there was indication of only very mild disease so basically remission was achieved according to my gastroenterologist.	"Edema, weight gain, round face occurring about 3 weeks into the treatment. Insomnia, headache and hperactivity occurred at 50 mg daily, and subsided when dose decreased to 40 mg daily.
I was first diagnosed with Crohn's in 1980 and at that time not too much was known about effective treatments and so on.  My gastroenterologist at the time prescribed 5mg of prednisone daily for an indefinite period of time. This did not help at all, in fact I became sicker and sicker, lost a lot of weight and had frequent diarrhea and severe cramps all day. I became osteopenic and had a bowel perforation 2 years later.  The perforation was believed to be due to the long term prenisone I was taking.  I had a bowel resection done.  A new Gastroenterologist started me on a new treatment schedule."

3091	minocycline	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	rosacea/ acne	cleared acne rosacea.	"I became very pale. Gained weight likely due to overburdened liver condition from the drug. Severe bruising on my calves and thighs ( a stated side effect of the drug ), likely yeast overgrowth in abdominal area which lead to bloating, etc.
Graying of the teeth, especially lower teeth, bluish at roots. Lethargy, lack of concentration."	My acne/ rosacea began at age 14, and was treated only topically with harsh over the counter products, with poor result. I began taking high doses of Tetracyclean at age 20. By age 30 I was also adding clindamycin topical solution to help control or dry out the breakouts. Even so, this combined effort was only mildly effective. I never drank alcohol, caffeine, and avoided spicy food while drinking lots of water and having a healthy lifestyle. By age 38, I was introduced to Minocyclean which was immediately effective and controlled my acne/ rosacea. Within 4-5 years, my teeth began to grey, weight gain began, and severe bruising developed on my upper and lower legs. Two weeks ago I phased out of the Minocycline and adopted a strong Probiotic ( 15 billion mc of acidophilus, etc. ) regimen with additional herbal supplement to treat yeast and parasites. I continue to use the topical Clindamycin, and so far the result is very controlled and manageable skin. I am monitoring my teeth and anxious to see if the bruising disappears before long. Antibiotics use create yeast in our bodies, which Acne and Rosacea thrive on. Rid yourself of the drugs, and use the natural supplements instead, and eliminate irritating triggers. Been on antibiotics for 24 years, and now excited to see something finally able to free my from those drugs. The supplement can be found on CandidaFreedom. They also make a natural face soap with the same ingredients. Get off those horrible drugs and at least try it. Give yourself a month !

It is supposed to keep HSV 2 from erupting on the skin's surface or if it already has, it is supposed to reduce the duration of the lesions.	"I experienced very noticeable hair loss when washing my hair.  It seemed to go away after about 2 weeks, but this could also be when I lowered my daily total dose from 1200mg to 800mg.
When I again started taking 1200mg total per day, my hair loss seems to have returned."	"I was prescribed acyclovir for an initial diagnosis of HSV 2.  Initially one is supposed to take it 400mg 3x daily for 10 days.  I then chose to continue taking acyclovir as part of a ""suppressive therapy"" regimen.  At this time the dosing decreased to 400mg 2x daily."
3203	omnicef	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	This drug was prescribed because my daughter has had adverse side effects from penicillin based antibiotics (trunk rash/hives from amoxicillin for an ear infection). She had a sinus infection that we couldn't get rid of with natural remedies (salt water flush, tea, elevated sleeping) so we went the antibiotic route.	"Her side effects were almost immediate thoug it took my husband and I 3 doses (3 days) to figure it out.  For an almost three year old, her moods were fairly predictable.  She was irritable when she was hungry, tired, or needed to poop.  But about 24 hours after her first dose of Cefdinir! Her moods drastically changed to violent, out-of-control, scary, temper tantrums.  To the point where she was biting herself, Banging her head on the wall and hitting and kicking us with all her might.  And when we would try and stop her, it was like she didn't recognize us and would get scared and cry. 

It was disturbing and very upsetting for us a parents. We started doing research the next day and little info on the drug except for druglib.com and the official side effect page. We found drastic mood changes buried in the side effects information and discontinued use.

Our doctor didn't seem that concerned even after we explained the scary details. He prescribed aZ Pack for her symptoms and she has been fine ever since (we have a new doctor now though)."	"""Let&#039;s talk about my sickness first. I was dipping my self into a freezing water pool for approximately 5 minutes  a day.

However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me.	There was one morning I only had an 80 calorie granola bar for breakfast and I took my dose and I ended up having terrible nausea. Will never make that mistake again.	So far my acne has improved.

It also moderately decreased Psoriatic Arthritis pains and also symptoms in nails and joints, but needed to be taken very regular for this.. Forgetting to take it twice a week already made it work less effective.

This was all the side effects I noticed. I did not like these side effects though and therefore discontinued when the psoriatic arthritis  seemed to be under control. When I discontinued Parlodel, I  took Cabergoline( with a much longer half life in the body) in a very low dosage to make sure that my Prolactin levels only gradually moved back.
I know once I took Parlodel and stopped and then took a Prolactin test 48h later and the levels were higher then without taking any meds.
So best is to decrease dosage slowly and not suddenly. I think this is the case with any ergot derivative."	"Taken for 6 months. Once daily, but half a tablet of 2.5 mg was taken after a while to reduce side effects. I found the best way to get a stable prolactin levels and best improvement was to take half a tablet once in morning and once in evening.

However, I have built up such a tolerance, I would have to apply Retin-A 2-3 times daily to achieve major peeling. It is hard to measure the anti-aging effect, as I don't know what I would look like without having used Retin-A.	I use once at night.

It helped me to get control of my life and avoid the severe depressions I was prone to, as well as putting a cap on my manias. I still felt mild highs or maybe natural euphorias but they are not manic-y and crazy. I even started being able to get sleepy at a normal hour and wake up in the morning. While on the medication I feel much clearer in general in my thoughts, so if I still feel down or up I am more confident in my ability to manage it.

Like twice a month!!	ocassional diarrhea and headache.	I began getting cold sores about 5 years ago, when I was 35.  I would get them 3-4 times per year, especially when the weather changed.  My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still, the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior, so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours, especially if a cold sore errupts.  Now I don't know what I'll do.  It scares me and I'm stressed over that as well which doesn't help.  I feel plagued!  I don't know what else to try.  Maybe Acyclovir?

Whilst Alprazolam is extrememly effective for immediate reduction in arousal, I find Lorazepam more effective for overall lowering of anxiety.It has been especially helpful to start the day with little or no anxiety rather than with a high arousal level immediately needing management or medication.	"As with all Benzodiazepines withdrawl is very noticeable if undertaken quickly. Lightheadedness, anxiety, dizzy spells, general feeling unwell.

3133	duragesic	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	severe chronic pain	Extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (I used Hydrocodone APAP and/or Percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.)	It is a very strong opioid, which is highly sedating, especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness. Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.)

After release from the hospital, a persistent abdominal pain was experienced.  Normal N-SAID pain relievers were not used because of stomach irritation and I am unresponsive to acetaminophen.

Before the Geodon I suffered from depression for months at a time. I haven't been or felt suicidal at all since beginning the drug. With Geodon I am on an even keel. By that I mean that I do not suffer from the peaks and valleys of typical bi-polar disorder. I no longer have manic episodes for days and then sink into a dark depression. It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away.	The side effects are: dry mouth, possible headache,	"""Geodon is wonderful for me. For a very long my mind was cluttered with particular obsessions. I couldn&#039;t think straight. I&#039;ve tried Luvox, Anafranil and a few other augmenters, nothing worked. Now, I take a low dose of Geodon 40mg a day with 300mg Luvox--and have success.

3193	omnicef	3	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	sore throat	The treatment cured the sore throat for which it was perscribed.	During the 10 days taking the drug there were no side effects, however the day after the last dosage, I began having severe diarrhea, which persisted and was diagnosed as a bacterial infection called clostridium difficil, caused by the antibiotic I had taken.	I took omnicef orally for 10 days.  After the clostridium difficil was diagnosed, I had to start a new course of drugs which had to be repeated before the new infection/condition was cured.
1709	retin-a-micro	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Skin became smoother, fewer breakouts	Dry skin was easily remedied with moisturizer.  My skin is aggravated by sunscreens and that concerns me, but using Clinique moisturizer has assisted with the dryness and I have not experienced any irritation.   For sun protection,  I just put on a hat when I am exposed to the sun and thus far I have had to problems with sun irritation.	I use the retin a every night as needed if there is a breakout for about 4 weeks.
3140	ortho-novum	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	The prevention of pregnancy was the benefit in addition to almost completely eliminating a monthly menstrual cycle.  Other than that, there were no other benefits involved in taking this medication.  The benefits at the time that I was taking this drug outweighed the risks. However, at this time, the risks and side effects now outweigh the benefits.	After going off of the birth control pill, I noticed an elevation of mood.  When I began taking the pill after being off of it for a while, I noticed the difference in my mood.  My mood is much more consistently positive when not on the drug.  In addition, now that I am older, I have no desire to take this medication as the potential side effects/risks are too high for women who are 30+. The risks that most concern me are risk of blood clots and stroke even though I have never been a smoker.	I took the birth control pill for approximately 10 years fairly consistently. There were periods of time during those 10 years when I did not take the drug.  I am no longer taking the birth control pill and do not currently see this as a viable option for me given my age and potential side effects.

3266	zoloft	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	While I definitely did notice some improvement in my depression, I believe that Zoloft is far from being a truly effective antidepressant drug. My depression had somewhat subsided and my panic attacks were less severe, albeit not completely gone.	From my personal experience, this drug exerts its effects mainly through a total numbing of one`s emotions. I had become a zombie, not feeling depressed but at the same time not feeling any positive emotions. My emotions had been totally flattened. My libido was gone. I had absolutely no desire for any kind of sexual activity.	"50 mg per day, in the mornings. Total duration of the treatment: 3 years.
During the treatment course, attempts were made to titrate the dosage to 100 mg per day, but I couldn`t tolerate it."
2362	propecia	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hairloss	With using generic finasteride there's no doubt that further hairloss has been prevented in my case.  Before beginning on this, my hairloss was rapidly escalating, both at the front and back, and this ceased and slightly reversed once started, and hasn't progressed since.	Definitely loss of libido, tiredness, some fogginess of thought, loss of muscle tone, occasional testicular pain, lowered blood pressure, increased floaters in vision, some gynecomastia when cycling down (minimised by taking Zinc on those days, but I would say not to discontinue this medication suddenly if taking a break or quitting).	Mostly generic Proscar - 5mg tablets cut into six equal pieces - 4 days on and one day off in a continuing cycle.

The cream itched and burned severely to the point of being nearly intolerable for the first week.  The burning subsided in the second week, but not to the point of being usable on a daily basis.	Application of cream nightly 15 minutes after washing.  Product information advised waiting, but it still burned and itched when applying it after waiting.  it had no real visible effect during the time I used it.  I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because I felt a very subjective glimmer of potential improvement at the end of the period, but not enough to overcome the pain.

2514	motrin	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sprained ankle	The Ibuprofen helped relieve pain and swelling from the sprained ankle. It lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain. Swelling was substantially lowered after a week period and steps were taken to allow the ankle to regain flexibility due to subsiding of pain.	There were no treatment side effects except for occasional nausea or drowsiness. Drowsiness however helped the patient sleep faster and thus avoid discomfort of laying in bed with a sprained ankle. Overall it simply lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain.

I now receive a blood test for liver abnormalities every 1 1/2 to 2 years, along with the rest of my regular bloodwork at normal checkups. So far, there have been no indications of any problems.

I'm also taking 200 mg per day of co q10 to replace what the Liptor diminishes. I do wish that my physician had mentioned this to me when he prescribed the Lipitor, but I actually found out about co q10 and lipitor through reading Dr Oz and Rizen's book ""You, Staying Young"". Upon asking my doctor about the co q10, he was familiar with it in relation to Lipitor usage, but never brought it up on his own. I realize that I would have continued taking Lipitor without any co q10 addition if I hadn't stumbled upon those facts by accident myself, and wish that when a physician prescribes a medication that they would also suggest any other supplements that should be taken or avoided along with the prescription.

Overall, this drug has been very successful for me. As I understand it, most people have to take a much higher dose than i do to obtain similar benefits, so I'm fortunate in this area, as I don't like to take much medication."

I would get an upset stomach if I didn't eat at the time I took the medication.	Chantix somehow seems to suppress the pleasure part of the brain.  Before you realize it... you will have gone a whole day or maybe days/weeks without even thinking about a cigarette subconcsiously and when you do smoke a cigarette there is little to no euphoria or any other sensation for that matter, its just the taste of smoke and nicotine.  I also found it suppressed my appetite and my desire to drink, as well.

There is a mild, physical addiction property.  Over the ten years that I have used this medication, I have slowly reduced by dosage from 50 mg down to 30 daily.  There was nauseousness and sweating, but I got through it.

When people say that prescription medicine isn't safe, I can only reply that my choices are either laying in bed because the pain is to great, or taking the medication and being able to function.  I am still limited in my physical activity, but I'm working and not constantly focused on the pain."	I take the Oxycontin three times a day - morning, lunch and dinner.  It is recommended to take on a full stomach, though I've never noticed an issue when I haven't.  If I take my regular dose one to two hours after it's due, my back pain is very severe, so I know it's working.

I was experiencing fatigue, nausia, sleeping problems and other typical flu or cold symptoms, but I think that was mostly due to the infections not the zithromax.

Prozac made me suicidally depressed. MAO-Inhibitors like Parnate worked very well for me, except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.  Wellbutrin seemed to be the only antidepressant that lifted me out of my depression, and it had the unanticipated benefit of getting me to quit smoking -- I went from smoking a pack of Camels a day to not smoking.	I often would get pounding headaches, in the front of my skull and at the sides, especially as the day wore on.  I also would feel sick to my stomach early in the day, which would be exacerbated by coffee.  I got tremors. Occasionally I'd get migaines.	I took 2 100 mg of the Wellbutrin, 20mg of Ritalin and a 10 mg of a beta blocker (I can't remember the name) in the morning.  Then at 3 I took the other 200 mg of the Wellbutrin; at night I took the Serzone (before it was yanked from the market) and the Trazodone.  I took a drug holiday from the Ritalin over the weekend, but over the years I eventually increased the dosage to 35mg of Ritalin in the morning.

After I stopped taking the Lipitor, most of the pain stopped.  The muscle pain is gone, but some of the joint pain has continued.	The doctor perscribed the Lipitor for my high cholesterol.  I questioned it because though my overall chloesterol was high, my HDL was high and my triglycerides were very low.  Lipitor lowered both LDL and HDL.

At Christmas - I decided to 'attack' the area again to clear it for the Summer. I used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  I then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  I could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 
I used a thin smear of Acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  If I left the cream off - they would start again.  I persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and I have healthy unbroken wart free skin."	"None - In fact it gave great relief to sore irritated skin as new 'wart' blister tried to form. 

I suggest a clinical trial to be used in conjunction with cryotherapy to prevent spread and regrowth - once warts are treated. It is certainly more successful in eliminating 'emerging warts' and preventing regrowth than the recommended salicylic acid - which does more harm then good."	"""I used to have cold sores all the time when I was a child, either when exposed to too much cold or when exposed to too much heat. Finally, I found a doctor who gave me a prescription (just a few years ago, I&#039;m already an adult) and the Doctor prescribed Zovirax 200 mg 5x a day for 5 days. When I am able to take the medicine as soon as I feel the blister forming, the blister will only last for a day; it will grow and then burst and crust over within twenty four hours, so I&#039;ve never really had to take the medication for more than 2-3 days.

2623	depo-provera	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	I was taking this drug as birth control, and it has been extremely effective.  (No children, yet!) The fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great, so it is difficult to miss a dose. (Unlike the pill, which you take everyday, and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  As an added bonus, I no longer have my period, which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  I no longer suffer from PMS symptoms, either.  I can not complain about this drug at all.	I have not experienced any side effects from this medication.  Losing my period was an anticipated side effect, and although many feel that this is too much for them and discontinue use of this drug, it is a good side effect for me.  Also there are studies that show bone mineral density is affected by this drug, but I have undergone a bone density scan, with normal results.  This is great, considering I have been on Depo for nine years now, since I turned nineteen and for most of my twenties.	This drug is administered into a muscle by injection four times a year, by a physician.  The shot is given every ten to thirteen weeks.  Besides being used as birth control, it is also used to treat other conditions.

I felt slow, distant, and complacent.  I felt like a dumbed-down, watered-down version of myself.  The physical effects were also disturbing: I developed a dark brown discharge and grew black hairs around my nipples.  But the most extreme side effects actually occurred when I went OFF the pill, which I had to attempt twice before I could get through it: I experienced the most severe depression of my life, several week-long, heavy periods, hair loss, and very bad acne.	Typical: 1 pill per day.
719	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant, or not monitored by your doctor, Accutane really helped my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING! THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.	Some of my side effects were really dry lips, sensitive eyes,burning sensation on my face, sensitive skin (if I scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain...	FIrst treatment at 16 years old. 2 pills a day of 40mg. With food.  At 26 years old and 105 lbs I took only 1 pill a day that was 40mg. Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.
2940	tofranil-pm	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	After 2-3 weeks complete abatement of panic attack symptoms.  After one year tried to stop taking them but within 3 weeks symptoms were back.  continued for two more years and stopped taking them.  Have not had any symptoms for @10 years now	hyperactivity for up to 8 hrs after taking.	started at 5 mg then increased every 5-7 days up to 25 mg.  Hyperactivity decreased with longer treatment
3728	lamictal	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	seizure disorder	Effective at controlling seizures without dizziness	There were no side effects	I took Dilantin for decades.  My doctor moved me to Trileptal; it was not 100% effective and caused dizziness, plus it was very expensive.  Lamictal controls my seizures, although I still get headaches (auras).  I would like to be completely free of these headaches, but this is still better than previous medications.
2075	metformin	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anti-aging prophilatic	At the recommendation of the Life Extension foundation, I was taking 1850 mg per day of metformin prophilatically -- as an anti-aging medicine. Gene assay testing by Biomol resveals that metformin surpresses the Sir1 gene, acting as a calorie reduction memetic. Calorie Reduction is the only currently proven way to extend life span, and the hope is that metformin will mimic this. Resveratro ( herb ) also reputably does this.		Metformin reduced my fasting blood glucose by about 10 pints, and my AC1 by 20%.
4007	celexa	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, irritability	The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.	The side effects I experienced with Celexa were heart palpitations during the first few weeks of taking it, which later subsided.  Yawning was also a side effect, but it went away after a couple of months.	I take 1 1/2 40 mg. tablets of Celexa once a day.
3183	desyrel	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	I did sleep reliably and without waking up in the middle of the night	gradually got more and more sedated during the day.  I functioned as though my IQ had dropped about 30 points.  It kinda dumbed me down until I was screwing up at work--forgetting details, working slowly, not able to focus, etc.  Also, I became very unassertive--not like me at all. When I realized what was happening, I went off it--and had a significant withdrawal reaction--shaking, extremely anxious, really weird.  The withdrawal reaction subsided in a couple of days.	"I was prescribed this drug for insomnia.  My MD told me that it had been used as an anti-depressant, but didn't work well for that, but was good for insomnia.  She originally prescribed 25 mg, and suggested I work up from that if 25 was ineffective.  I am very drug sensitive, so when 25 mg. really knocked me out and I could barely wake up the next day, I cut the pills in half, and that seemed to work--but I just gradually got the effects mentioned above.  I realized later that I had taken the same drug, higher dose, under the name Desyrel when I was 43 for post partum depression.  It didn't work, and it made my blood pressure go down--the number I remember is 77/44.  Same reaction--very sedated, confused, etc.  I would never have taken it, but it was not identified as Desyrel, even on the pharmacy information sheet, so I didn't realize what it was.  The weird thing about this drug (for me) is that it makes me so confused, but subtly, that I can't think clearly enough to realize what is happening until it gets pretty bad.  I know I am very sensitive, and this may be a completely idiosyncratic reaction, but I don't think so.  When I talked to the pharmacist about it she said ""Yeah, some people just can't take it.""  I know people who take 300 mg a night--and they are fine!."
4158	locoid-lipocream	3	Ineffective	No Side Effects	nummular eczema	Unfortunately this did nothing to heal the skin. It was an expensive experiment for the doctor to misdiagnose my condition, which was not sever but had been present for 9+ months. Eventually I was switched to fluocinonide, which seemed to do only a little better.	No real assistance or side efects were noticed.	Treatment was applied to affected areas on both legs twice daily for 2 weeks.
3907	nexium	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	gastritis, nausea, fullness	reduced nausea from continual to episodic, feeling of fullness decreased	none noted in short term	Daily medication first thing in morning prior to eating.  Also eliminated citrus fruit, tomotoes, coffee, alcohol, tea, chocolate.  After several months was able to add back tomatoes, tea and alcohol.  Citrus fruits and juices and coffee still not tolerated.  Also enrolled and practice meditation for stress reduction.  Unsure of the benefits of this.
1054	oracea	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	perioral dermatitis	It cured the rash around my upper lip and chin area	I personally had no side effects. This is a low dose tetracycline antibiotic, so you should avoid the sunlight and tanning beds while taking it.  It's typical side effects are the same as any antibiotic.	I took the prescribed dose for 6 months(even though my dermatologist said I could stay on it indefinitely). The rash disappeared within 1-2 weeks.I was very pleased with the medication.  It has been 1 1/2 years since my breakout and so far I have not had the rash return.
2860	soma	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	broken ribs	The Soma made the patient agitated and did not work. The Flexril made the patient relax and sleep enough to let the rib heal nicely.	The Wellbutrin at times causes confusion in thought transfer.	"""Does absolutely nothing for me except make me a little dizzy. I&#039;m in more pain now than before I started taking it.  Absolutely the most useless prescription I&#039;ve ever had."""
1674	claritin	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	allegry	cleared head and sinsus	"1rst week no sleep
after 1rst week - tired"	taken daily for sinsus pressure
2220	allegra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	This drug alleviates my allergic responses--itchy eyes and sneezing.  It's effective because if I don't use it, my symptoms return.	I'm not sure if this drug has a drying effect.  I don't think so, but I really don't know how to tell.	I take a pill approximately every 12 hours.  I try to keep well hydrated.
2359	propecia	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	male pattern baldness	Ostensibly this product will prevent further hair loss. While the initial male pattern baldness is mild, I fear worsening of the condition, and am taking this as a preventive measure.	I experienced sharp bursts of pain in the top rear left quadrant of my head intermittently for about seventy-two hours of commencing treatment. These subsided and may or may not be related to the medication.	"""I have been using this medication for just over a year now.  Hair has re-grown over my crown but the top and temple areas are still quite thin, have not re-grown and not responded in the same way.  I guess these areas have not gotten any worse either.  Certainly I don%u2019t notice hair in the shower or in my hair brush as much.

On the sexual function side of things I have noticed a decrease performance wise, I guess there was always going to be a tradeoff. The main thing I think to watch out for is the effect the medication has on PSA levels and if you are already being monitored for this prior to starting Propecia it is worth bearing in mind and reminding your physician about the PSA lowering effect of Propecia."""
3147	tylenol	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	fever	"Relieve pain and fever,muscle pain and also no sneezing.
Temerature was for 105 C for one week and found normal after taking
medicine in one week for one tablets three times a day. it is wonderful medicine
to get the normal position for headache,flu,cold and fever"	stomach uncomfort, urticaria	flu and cold, took one tablets three times a day and found normal within one week
974	macrobid	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bladder infection	No treatment benefit, because the complete prescription was not used because of adverse side effects.	The side effects were horrible after one dose - severe dizziness - room spinning.  Loss of balance.  Severe nausea, vomiting.	Supposed to take 1 tablet every 12 hours, if I remember correctly - did not take more than one dose because of horrid side effects.
2058	prempro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	unusual periods	"I started to take Prempro, the lowest dose, at age 56, because I would have freak periods - every six months.  I never really went through menopause.  No hot flashes, no night sweats.  But just a period out of the blue.  My doctor put me on 1 pill/day, .3, 1.5, and then I started to decrease the dose slowly to 1/2 pill per day, then 1/3 pill/day, then 1/4 pill/day.  Now I take one pill/week.  I find that the Prempro keeps my skin smooth and prevents incontinence, which started to happen when I tried to quit the drug entirely.
I still take it, but I do have water retention, even with this small dose."	Water retention, breast enlargement (not a bad thing).	"""I have been on this medication for 37 days.  My day and night sweats are no longer severe. I only toss my comforter once a night as opposed to many times.  My day sweats are no longer embarrassing, e.g. while talking with coworkers, I would without warning began to get warm, hot, and then dripping in sweat to include my hair.  My mood swings are gone, I am back to normal.  LOVING IT."""
2621	trileptal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	epilepsy	Controlled complex partial seizures.	Dizziness, fatigue, nausea	"""I developed TGN in 1997.  This is not the typical TGN since it was caused by a stress ulcer about 3/4&quot; from the left side of my mouth over the junction of three facial nerves.  About a year after the ulcer healed, the facial pain abruptly developed big time.  I was first prescribed Tegretol, but made me feel like a dope.  Trileptal was  then prescribed and I have cut it down to only 75 mg at night.  Occasionally take 150 mg Trileptol 1 X when my facial pain really tunes up.  Also rub in a little dab of Metrocream topically over that painful area that numbs my face just enough to minimize any pain.  """
1004	actiq	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	chronic pain	"Without question, Actiq is an extremely effective drug if you are in chronic severe pain and have no responsibilities.  Actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  It is fast acting in the subcutaneous, ""lollipop"" form and within minutes you are comfortable.
The flavor is also quite pleasant."	"Actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. Thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. Actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  Actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.
Actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than 6 months."	"Actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where
tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  It needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.
My  chronic  pain condition was followed by a Pain Center at a reputable hospital.  The use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for
my condition had failed.
Unfortunately, once Actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  I was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever I didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  I became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age 40 lost 4 molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" I was taking.
I had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  Fortunately my husband and I were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.
I have no memory of 2 years of my life, thanks to an ignorant, negligent doctor and the drug, Actiq.  
Believe it or not, my painful conditions are now completely under control now, and I am able to care for my husband and children, and work!  After my experience with Actiq I no longer believe in the use of pharmaceutical products as a whole, and owe my good health to diet, exercise and several natural supplements.  I have never felt better in my life!"
