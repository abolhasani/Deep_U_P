2200	boniva	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	osteoporosis	None. Due to side effects I was only able to take a single dose. I am now hoping that I do not have permanent damage from the single dose. Time will tell.	Extreme agonizing bone pain in neck and ribs; high fever for 1 1/2 days; debilitating pain in shoulder and neck to the point that I could not get out of bed for 4 days. I subsequently read that it can aggravate previous injuries where bones have been broken or damaged. I had an earlier neck injury and compression fractures in my spine. I believe these old injuries were antagonized by the Boniva.	"""I have experienced flu symtoms within the first 48 hours, and severe joint and bone pain.  I feel much worse than before I started taking Boniva. """
420	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	"I had my first migraine at age 10 and suffered for almost 60 years. Then Imitrex--a miracle!  Imitrex, finally, gave me my life back. As I get older and am now retired (72) and have less stress, I use the stat dose once or never during the year. The 50mg tablet usually returns me to normal within an hour. A ""generic"" has become available but is less Imitrex and more Naprosin, an anti-inflammatory,  which is cheaper for the manufacturer but not good long-term for the patient. My doctor is keeping me on the brand name. However, Humana has dropped Imitrex coverage, not wanting to pay the high cost, which never gets lower as the manufacturer won't release the patent.  Now I'm worried, having to pay the entire cost myself, which is impossible.  It's a horrible dilemma.  I can't pay for it and they won't.  What now?"	I have had no side effect at all, and I have been taking Imitrex since it came on the market.	"I don't know what you mean by ""details."""
3036	seroquel	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar i	The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.	There are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now, but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out.	I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa, depakote Triliptal and Lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start, 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later, as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil, 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety, although I don't need to very often.  The combination of seroquel, Paxil and lithium works best together for me.
3791	keflex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	post operative antibiotic	Prevention of post surgical infection and peace of mind following my minor outpatient surgery.	The mild side effects I experienced included fatigue and the abdominal bloating and intestinal tract upset that commonly accompanies any antibiotic treatment.  It would be helpful if the Patient Education information sheet included commentary about this phenomenon and instructions regarding using yogurt or supplements to prevent digestive difficulties.	The Patient Education information sheet mentioned hives and rash as potential side effects when taking this medication.  As a person who is allergic to dyes and food colorings, (a red, itching, burning, eczema like rash results when I ingest these additives) I find it unnecessary that the gel cap in which this medication is contained would have to be colored green or colored at all for that matter.  In order to avoid this unpleasant side effect, I opened each gel cap just prior to taking it, poured the medication out onto a spoon and swallowed it down as quickly as possible.  My surgical results were excellent and I did not experience any symptoms of infection.
744	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus allergy	Relief for my nasal clogging and breaht normally. Works great!	I've experienced no side effects, although there was some mild headache during the first day of use- this could have been due to other reasons.	Moved to a new area with a lot of trees / greenry and experiecing temporary allergies while there. got prescribed flonase with dosage described above, and felt much better.
385	seasonale	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	While taking this method of birth control, my period only came once every three months. It was much lighter than before and only lasted 3 days instead of 6, which was normal before. I didn't experience any bloating. It's a very cost-effective method compared to three-month supply of normal 28 day cycle pills.	I noticed a slight weight gain (about 2 pounds) and still had issues with breakouts on my face prior to starting my period. There was also breakthrough bleeding, although very slight, at the times when my period would normally hit.	"It's very easy to take one pill per day and only have one ""off"" week in three months."
2538	lamisil	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	toenail fungus	I received no benefit from the medication.  My prescribing physician told me it would take a full six months of this medication taken daily for it to be effective.  That's not going to work for me.	Total loss of taste and rapidly diminishing sense of smell.  Very bad taste in my mouth.  Feels like I'm sucking on a dirty copper penny all the time.  After one week of enduring the loss of my sense of taste and smell, I stopped taking the medication.  It's only been 2 days and these two senses have not yet returned, but I'm hopeful they will eventually.	I was to take the drug for 12 weeks after having liver function studies performed. I did not experience any untowards side effects having taken the medication for ther prescribed 12 weeks. I did not miss any doses during that time.

1431	adipex-p	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	weight loss	With in three days I felt the surge of energy that I expected. I no longer felt tired all the time. I was able to play with my kids more often and had the energy to work, clean, go to school, and still exercise for one hour a day. I felt alive and more like who I use to be. I'm happy again and currently have dropped 12 dress sizes thanks to my doctor and this medication he prescribed.	I had no side affects. I abslutly felt amazing while taking this pill.	Well their wasn't much treatment details.  You take the pill first thing in the morning and drink a glass of water with it.  It is an appetite suppressant.   It also gave me more energy as well, giving me more incentive to exercise, work around my house, etc....
208	elidel	6	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	eczema	Decreased eczema patches, however did not fully heal them. The treatment did not help my skin being scaly from eczema.	There were no noticeable side effects.	"""My daughter just turned two and has failed every conventional method of treating her eczema. We have seen multiple specialists and after much consideration ( due to the warnings and side effects) we decided to try Elidel. After 3 days she was almost clear. By one week she was free of eczema, severe itching  ( which is by far the worst symptom) and redness/ dry skin. We stopped the medication as directed and within one day she was in a FULL flare. We thought perhaps we did not use it long enough? We tried it again daily for another week and here we are again back in a full flare after daily use for two weeks! So discouraging! Has anyone exp. this???"""
3772	plavix	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	r.a.	This regimen eliminated, for the most part, the pain, stiffness, and exhaustion experienced with rheumatoid arthritis.	No side effects at all, other than returning me to an apparently more normal state of health.	Initially, stronger drugs such as cortisone were needed to control and stabilize the rheumatoid arthritis.  Once that was accomplished, the Plavix/Mobic treatment has been consistently effective for quite a few years.
3761	spironolactone	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hormonal acne	decrease in acne, and less oil in skin and hair	slight lack of energy, decreased sex drive, irregular menstrual cycle, - I experienced four periods in a span of a month and a half - slight dehydration, and more severe mood swings than usual	I took 25mg twice daily for three months. It was definitely effective in treating my acne, although I still received breakouts - just not NEAR as many. It didn't take very long to kick in, but by the middle of the second month I started to notice my lack of sexual desire. Did that disappointment me? Yes. During the last month and a half I was having issues with my menstrual cycle. I had four periods during that time. My usual cycle is typically somewhere between 35 and 45 days. So this worried me a little. By the end of the third month I was experiencing mood swings. Caused by my irregular menstrual cycle? Possibly. I don't know for sure. I would wake up mad, have a wonderful day, and then come home and cry myself to sleep. And why would I be so upset? No freaking clue, but I do know that it was entirely exhausting. If it weren't for such side effects, I would have rated this drug higher because it did exactly what I wanted and cleared my skin up.
2019	protonix	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Effective in helping to control acid reflux	none that i know of at the present time. But i do not know what damage it has done if any to any of my internal organs.	One tablet once a day
1814	humira	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	"I was initially placed on this medication several years ago for RA when Vioxx was pulled.  I religiously self administered the medication for two years and then decided to quit because I didn't believe that it was helping much.  I took a ""holiday"" for 16 months and then checked in with my rheumatologist.  She suggested that I restart the medicine based upon x-rays and blood work.  I have been on it again for 3mos...I feel better...less pain..more energy."	I have not experienced any side effects.	"""After having crohns for 47 years I just went on Humira 2 months ago.  So far so good."""
4148	percocet	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	buldging/ruptured disc	Pain is now under control to some degree.  Still have pain throughout body and down legs.  Before the medication I would not be able to get out of bed for sometimes days.  Even when I could get out of bed I would not be able to sit up or walk for more than 30 minutes before I had to lay down.  Now I am able to be up all day, walk and sit up for more than 3-4 hours at a time.	"It sometimes makes me feel ""high"", vision problems, coordination problems."	"All in all, it was effective, but not worth taking for the side effects.
Also, it is severly habit forming. If it is pain that can be managed with an over the counter product, I highly reccommend going that route."
3131	duragesic	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	cancer/constant pain	Having a constant level of pain relief by transdermal absorbpion.	After 6-16 hours I became quite sleepy and tired.  After a couple of hours of sleep, I awoke feeling as I usually do first thing in the morning.  A couple of hours later the sleepiness returned.	I was having considerable hip and shoulder pain.  Also, I had significant sciatic pain but the sciatica pain was not as chronic as the shoulder pain.  While using the fentanyl patch I was given facet block injections and as a result have had little problem with the sciatica.  The fentanyl patch also relieved tingling pins and nnedle like pain in my feet that I had in the mornings when I first woke up and put even a little of my weight down on my feet.  For me the patches served me for the time that I was using them.  I am however, glad that for now I do not currently use them.

On attempting to withdraw very severe side effects of withdrawal that lasted over one year: personality changes, anxiety, severe sleeplessness. A disaster!	Withdrawal had to be done very slowly over several months. I would NEVER use benzodiazepines ever again. They are for single use only. Have since learned that even after a few days use there can be rebound effects. These drugs are dangerous. Period.

I have more stability in my moods w/ better emotional control. I have fewer episodes of irritability and feel more calm and collected.

2040	cozaar	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	I must have tried 15 different blood pressure meds over the last 7 years.  None of them worked.  I was on Benicar, but the insurance no longer covered it.  So my Dr. switched me to Losartan.  WOW, what a difference.  I now have perfectly normal blood pressure.		"""I have been on Cozaar for many years.   I did have a nagging cough which neither I nor my doctor connected to Cozaar.   She thought the cough might be due to reflux and I started taking generic Omeprazole (Prilosec) and the cough went away.  I dont know if the Cozaar was causing the indigestion but if you like taking Cozaar and have a cough you might try this."""
789	ambien	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	sleep	The drug was very effective in helping me to fall asleep, and to get a good night's sleep.	After taking the drug for more than 2 nights in a row, I had a very difficult time sleeping without the medication on subsequent nights	Because of difficult nights without the drug after a few nights on the drug, I have sought out other sleep aid medications.

3042	seroquel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, gad	The greatest drug i have ever taken. I'm no longer on edge all the time - only thing that has calmed me down without making me a zombie. My anxiety has lessened tremendously. I have had no negative side-effects, it's fantastic!	None i have noticed other than drowsiness, which is why i take it before bed.	I get depression quite badly and one of the precursers to that is usualy a period of severe insomnia, over days or weeks. Taking the Seroquel helps to ensure I have enough sleep so that depression doesn't often become a big problem. I know it's prescribed as anti-psychotic, but for me it's the effect ot drowsiness that my doctor desired, as I have no psychoses.
1645	sumatriptan	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe migraine	I love imitrex, I could not get by as I have severe Migraines to where I can not function. Some time I will take up with one, but try to catch one if I feel it coming on.  It usally takes me about 45 minutes to and hour with tablets and 5 to 10 minutes with the injections. It is a wonderful drug. I use the generic tablets, cause they are a little cheaper with my insurance	SOme times I will have aching in my hands and my body like arthritis pain.  Feels like arthritis, that is the best way I can describe it, but I would rather have that pain than a migraine.	"""I&#039;ve used sumatriptan for about 2 years to treat my migraines that I&#039;ve had since I was 10. They&#039;re mostly period and stress related headaches. Nothing had ever helped and I&#039;m excited that I can finally get on with my life without laying bed for days suffering in pain. It works pretty quickly- 10 or 15 minutes after I take the medication. It&#039;s a life saver.
It does make my extremities tingly and sensitive to heat and cold. But overall I&#039;m thankful to have an option."""
860	valium	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	It was beneficial for alleviating nervousness and feelings of anxiety. I took one half tablet or a full tablet depending upon how anxious or nervous I was feeling. If particularly anxious/nervous sometimes I took one tablet plus a half. I didn't take this medication on a daily basis, but only when I was going to be involved in a nerve wracking experience.	Only mild slightly woozy feelings. Exacerbated when I took higher dose of 1 & 1/2 tablets	Valium was prescribed for the patient to use prior to having minor surgery to relieve his anxiety.
2563	inderal	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hypertension		Nearly died after a severe asthmatic reaction to this drug.  My OB prescribed this for me after Procardia XL caused me to have horrible headaches and nausea.  DO NOT take this drug if you have asthma.	Took one 40 mg pill at 8:45 in the morning.  By 9:30 am I could not breathe and 911 was called.  I lost consciousness before I was placed in the ambulance.  I awoke in the ER and was told that I NEVER should have been prescribed this medication.
449	lorazepam	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	I found that the benefits of this drug were marginal at best. My heart rate decreased and I felt slightly less anxious but I still had a feeling of unease especially during social situations. Social situations felt only barely tolerable.  Though symptoms were minimized slightly it wasn't worth the side effects.	The symptoms I had were one of feeling spacey, dizzy and slightly nauseous and I couldn't take these at work where I felt the most anxiety. These symptoms seemed to last what felt like quite a while at least 2 to 3 hours after taking them but in all honesty most anti anxiety and depression meds have little positive effect.	Treatment consisted of seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and all though the psychologist was marginally helpful I eventually turned to meditation and found a lot more relief than through medication and talk therapy.The psychiatrist tried to help me changing dosage and medication every couple of months but I never felt much relief.
3946	prilosec	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	barretts disease	I was actually throwing up a couple of times a week during the night. Found I had Barretts and the treatment cleared up the Barretts after about 5 years.	I have an artifical hip and have constant discomfort where implant was put into femur. I was having quite a bit of back pain and about a year ago started lifting moderate weights about 3 days a week and that seemed to clear up the problem. Sometimes when I overeat or accidently drink a lot of alcohol I get extreme chest pain. I actually break out into a sweat and the pain works from center of my back to front of my chest. After it subsides which is usually 15 to 20 minutes I will be extremely exhaused.The first time it happened I thought I was actually having a heart attack.So to counter the issue I try to eat less at a meal and nibble more often during the day. I still don't know I the moderate discomfort in my leg is the medication, so I guess I will live with it.I have read a bit about the different symptoms and being a little older its hard to determine if its drugs or age causing some of the issues.	"I was diagnosed with a moderate to severe case of GERG with an esophageal hernia over 7 years ago, and spent two years at physicians request trying a mix of different OTC drugs.   NO OTC drug worked to stop the burning and the coughing after meals caused by GERD. I tried most everything you'd find in the OTC shelf in a drug store.  Tums, Zantac, etc. etc. etc.   Finally, doctor ordered Prilosec for me, 1/day, 20mg, taken in am before eating.  At that time Prilosec with still not yet over the counter, still requiring a physician prescription.  It worked beautifully and I have taken it since, daily.  If I don't take it, symptoms immediately occur after eating.   It does NOT however stop the cough that occurs after eating or otherwise from GERD. Recently, I have had to increase my dose ""occasionally"" to 1 pill also before dinner, but that is usually only if I'm eating later than expected.  I have never taken Nexium -- the HMO didn't cover it, but since Prilosec works so well, I don't feel the need to experiment."
1951	lyrica	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia	I think that the Lyrica was starting to help with the pain, but the side-effects were just too severe to continue.	I felt extremely drugged and dopey.  Could not drive at all while on this med.  Also had extreme ankle and feet swelling and couldn't even wear shoes.	See above
531	trazodone	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/difficulty sleeping	I took it before bed, and it helped me get to sleep. It also helped me cope during a difficult time emotionally.	The drug is an anti-depressant. The side effect was sleepiness, which is also therapeutic when taken at night.	"""Since around age 4 years old I&#039;ve had a problem with sleeping. After having my kids my sleep what sleep I was getting went away.

So I returned to my old HCP and with my PTSD and OSTD he put me on traz. And first night on traz 50mg I slept for 12 HOURS OMG it was so amazing only problem I see is its like a alarm clock....I wake up at 4:00am no sweats...no dry mouth...etc. I never knew sleeping felt so good and I&#039;m almost 50 yrs old.

The effects tapered off in the second month with the total weight loss to be estimated at 6 kg. Subsequently I felt less urge to snack	I experienced mood swings, short temper, thirst. I was constantly thirsty and had mild tension headaches too. Often, I will flare up for no good reason but the outbursts went away swiftly. I also observed that I am quite bloated after food.	I took the medication for 3 months, 3 times a week to prevent addiction. The treatment is optional with Mediaxal another weight loss drug which I opted out. I noticed an obvious decrease in appetite during the first 3 weeks with a gradual return of my appetite. I went back for a review every 2 weeks where my blood pressure and weight was recorded. The medicine was supplemented with a low calorie diet and exercise.
2957	zyban	9	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	smoking	I stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. I never picked up another cigarette. The cravings for the sensation of smoking, as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp, and lessened within a short period of time. I was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. Incidently I lost 4 - 5 Kgs within 4 weeks of taking the drug.	There was a feeling of complete disassociation from reality, people, feelings. I felt as if i was depressed. However at the same time I experienced times of being unable to control any emotions, my mood swings were extreme and I was completly unable to stop some fairly manic expressions of emotions. This could have been the nicotine withdrawal, but continued for a two - three month period. I stopped the drug about three weeks before prescribed as I became tired of the inability to feel happy / pleased / content. I experienced mild episodes of anxiety, vertigo and breathlessness - as I was aware these were side effects they did not overly concern me.	I took one 150 mg tablet for seven days, stopped smoking on the sixth day. As prescribed I took one tablet twice a day for six weeks. After consulting the doctor over my cncerns of the side efeects I took one 150 mg tablet a day for the next four weeks.

I suffered swollen and extremely sore throats with lots of mucus gathering up at the back of my throat. Because of this, I ended up having my tonsils and adenoids removed separately but this did not help at all. I also relieved several treatments for antibiotics but this was wasted as all they did was lowered my immune system. After being diagnosed with an airborne allergy, I took one tablet daily, they worked on the first day and completely helped.	The drowsiness was overwhelming, I was sleeping for about 16hours a day with no relief after and my appetite increased rapidly. I was consuming about three times my usual intake.	used the claritin D 24 hours seems to work better than the 12 hour.  overall with continued use my allegies seem to diminish, liek the sneezing and runny nose, itchy eyes.  I mostly have seasonal outdoor allegies.  I'm ot allegic to pets or other similar things so I'm not sure how effecive it would be on those symptoms.

2492	remeron	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	ibs/anxiety	I had mono which went undiagnosed and that, along with other life stressors had me very sick and run down. I was diagnosed with Irritable bowel syndrome and suffered from severe nausea. I was unable to sleep or eat and began to lose weight. I had tried many anti-nauseants to no avail and began remeron as a last resort. My nausea all but disappeared. I only became nauseated when working nights. My anxiety level also somewhat decreased.	I was very sleepy at first and would sleep up to 14 hours per day. I was also recovering from mono at the time, which may have contributed to my drowsiness. I felt a bit dazed at first as well.	"""I was suffering extreme anxiety, weight loss and insomnia due to a diagnosed medical condition.  I tried several sleep aids and SSRIs.  Nothing worked.  Because of the weight loss I was prescribed Remeron.  It was a Miracle for me!  I slept through the night for the first time in months, relieved anxiety and I started gaining weight.  Over time, my anxiety went away, but I stayed on because I loved having an appetite (I had no appetite for years).  I guess I stayed on too long.  After 6 years I decided I should get off.  I was dependent. I suffered flu like symptoms for weeks--nausea, exhaustion, gastrointestinal upset, feeling like low-grade fever.  I finally got rid of the nausea, but if I&#039;m off for 2 weeks, the gastrointestinal upset creeps in.  I now take 3.25mg 1X week."""
947	betamethasone	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	trochanteric bursitis	After the administration of the first injection the pain decreased, however after a period of two weeks it returned. A second injection was administered. There was no improvement and undesirable side effects, as described below, appeared.	Two days after the 2nd injection the body weight started to increase. In the forth day it was 1.5 kg heigher. In the following four days it returned to almost normal.  During this period I felt tired and dizzy and fainted at one occasion. The blood test indicated that the concentrations of potassium and sodium were outside the normal limits (Potassium too high, 5.3 mmol/L and sodium too low, 134 mmol/L), in a dangerous range. Similarly to the pH, the safe range for these two ions is narrow. Four days later the potassium was OK, 5.1 mmol/L albeit high, but the sodium, remained unchanged. In additional three days, the sodium was OK,136 mmol/L ,albeit low. I continued to feel tired for the next two weeks	Two injections were administered in a period of two weeks
807	ambien	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	sleeplessness	ability to sleep at night and through the night was substantially increased	patient was often dizzy the following day and had considerable difficulty concentrating or remembering small details and facts.  Patient often felt extremely anxious when driving or doing other activities which required concentration, since patient often felt a little dopey or unable to concentrate.	"swallow the pill with water before bed. I was also using ambient because I was waking up in the middle of the nights and couldn�t fall asleep again. I got this drug prescribed for 10 days only. He told me I shouldn�t be taking it longer. 

I hear that ambient is addictive. Six years do sound too long. 
I am on Seroquel now. It treats both my depression and sleeping problems. You can also get it only by prescription."
1701	retin-a-micro	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	cystic acne	I didn't get any blackheads, and my cystic acne was considerably reduced. If a I started getting a giant underground pimple, it would clear up in a week. Without treatment, it could take a month or two to go away.	Extremely dry skin - flaking and patchy around mouth and chin. Although the peeling wasn't as bad as with regular Retin-A, the redness and flaking skin affected my appearance.  My skin is too sensitive and I could not consider using this product on a long term basis.	I applied it every night before bedtime.
1514	lotrel	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	I have slightly high blood pressure on the diastolic side. Lotrel did a good job at maintaining good levels without increasing my pulse which I experienced with other BP meds.	After introducing Lotrel within two weeks I notices small red dots appear on my ankles which I thought was just a heat rash. I developed Petechiae which is the bleeding of small capillaries in the skin or mucous membrane. It appears as round pinpoint sized dots that vary in colour from red to blue or purple. These dots most commonly appear on the legs but can appear all over the body. Also an onset on Acne developed on my back at about the same time which was quite severe, and I have never had Acne related problems, even in my youth.	Currently my physician has taken me off of my BP meds to allow the Petechiae to fade, and to ensure that the reaction was indeed related to the Lotrel. It has been 4 days and slowly the rash and redness is mellowing.

Nosystemic side effects were noted, as adapalene is not very well absorbed by the body	Application nightly after washing.

Felt nausea and had a hard time keeping food down. Stomach pains and a headache.	Took four 250 mg pills at once, so 1,000 mgs all together. Quite a hefty dose on my stomach but it worked.
341	neurontin	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	low back pain, radiating to left leg	To tell the truth, I did not benefit very much from this medication, even though I was taking maximum doses, the pain remained almost the same with or without medication. Maybe some people are more responsive to these kind of treatment, unfortunately not in my case.	I did not experience many side effects, even though I was taking many pain medications at a time, I could say very little drowsiness, but compared with other people taking the same medication, I would say I tolerated quite well the medication.	"My medical condition was the result of a disc herniation at L5-S1 level, with no compression of the nerve root, besides use of NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and Neurontin, I had little response. I underwent also Phisiotherapy, Ultrasonograpy and other therapy. I have to say that finally I decided to receive alternative therapy (Accupunture) and started practising Qi Gong and that in a few weeks I abandoned all medication and the pain began to ameliorate to a total recovery. 
I still believe that drugs are effective and are indicated in specific conditions, but I also Know that not everybody responds in the same way to medication."
1439	tirosint	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	low thyroid	I had experienced decreased energy and increasing tiredness for several years.  It got to the point I was taking naps for the first time since I was a small child, and still didn't feel refreshed.  I also felt cold frequently and had put on a good 20 pounds in a year.  When I went for my annual physical, my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  I thought it was advancing middle age.  Fortunately, my MD put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  I was very low.  Within two weeks, I felt energized and my mood improved.  I have shed some (not all, darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower.	I had none except for a few hot flashes (well past menopause) that went away in the first few weeks.  I have never been a pill-taker for fear of side effects, but this was a good experience.  Fortunately, the initial dose was effective and did not need adjustment.	"""I bless Tirosint, after suffering so many gastrointestinal and allergic problems with Synthroid.  Tirosint has made all these disappear and I feel more normal again,  even in just a week of switching. Cost is the only criteria.  I am told you can get coupons."""

Cipro reduced the fever from 104.2 to 97.6 within 5 or 6 day/cured the kidney infection..	I threw up the first dose, which was two tablets,approximately one hour after taking it.  I also experienced headaches for one to two hours after taking the cipro  for first few days.  Other than that, I just kept getting better, day by day.	I took 2 tablets, then I took 1 tablet twice a day after eating.  I also drank lots and lots of water and cranberry juice. After approx. 5 days, I no longer had side effects and the fever was gone.  I actually felt perfectly fine after about 6 days or so.

The first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  I really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  Also, I oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  So one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics."	"Hard to say.  

During the fifteen years I took it, my pores enlarged and became clogged.  That may have been due to age and other factors--but I could not help but suspect that some of the heavy waxes and oils used in the product may have contributed.

Metrogel left an ashy white residue, so I switched to the cream.  Maybe the gel would have less clogging effect.  

Later, I got prescription insurance coverage and had to take a generic, which may have had even cheaper inactive ingredients."	i used the new metrogel.  the old formula is no longer available.  The new one doesn't work for me.

1742	topamax	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sedative/hypnotic - to induce sleep	topamax was originally prescribed to eventually replace in part or totally the Elavil I was taking as sleep med.  Elavil and Effexor were thought to initiate cravings for carbohydrates that would lead to overeating and overweight.  I was taking 300mg Elavil each night.  The goal was to completely switch from Elavil to Topamax.  Topamax also had the added benefit of preventing migraines which I am prone to because of my hydrocephalis caused by a sub arachnoid cyst. I have a VP shunt	I had to stop increasing the dose of Topamax when I reached 225mg because I experienced peripheral neuropathy in my fingertips and also blurred vision.  I am now taking 150 mg topamax and 225mg elavil hs.	Topamax was prescribed due to incresing occurance of migraines.  Dosage started at 50 mg and was increased to 125 until migraines were under control.  Imitrex is taken as need when migraines occur.

3846	voltaren	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	chronic back pain	I was perscribed this after I decided to quite narcotic pain killers.  I was taking fairly large doses of Oxycotin and switched to Voltaren 75mg.  They will not touch my pain.  I guess I have a high tolerance for pain meds.  I don't believe they would be effective for people with chronic moderate to severe pain.	Upset stomach.	I was perscribed 75mgs X 2 per day.  I take double that amount and still have very little relief.
1861	augmentin	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sinus infection	Seem to have a bad sinus / nasal infection, now up into ethmoids.  Seemed to start with attempt to drain tear duct, but blocked.  Helping but not kicking it.  They've now changed me to my choice of Omnicef or Levaquin, I chose the Omnicef.  We'll see if it does the trick.	None.  I do pretty well on penicillin type drugs.	Given to me by my PCP for sinus infection.
2287	lexapro	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	The benefits to the treatment were that my anxiety was significantly decreased.  It took almost two months for the benefits to kick in, but when they did it was well worth it.  The depression also decreased significantly.  I'm not sure if that was due to the addition of Wellbutrin, or if the reduction in anxiety was so great as to reduce the depression.	There were several side effects worth noting.  First of all, the Lexapro caused serious lethargy and loss of energy.  Taking the pill at night rather than in the morning helped with this side effect, as did the addition of Wellbutrin.  Weight gain also occurred, as well as a severe decrease in libido.  When weaning off of the Lexapro, severe dizziness occurred.	10 mg of Lexapro (daily) was prescribed.  It was taken every day for nearly two years, in conjunction with check-ups with the prescribing psychiatrist every six months.  (The psychiatrist determined that the anxiety was due to a chemical imbalance and not situational.  Therefore, regular visits and/or therapy were not necessary.)  After two years on the medication, treatment ended due to inability to tolerate the side effects noted above.  During the weening process, severe dizziness occurred.  The only way to alleviate the dizziness was to take a Lexapro pill.  As the weening continued, dizziness occurred less often and longer periods of time elapsed before it was necessary to take another pill.  Eventually, the dizziness ceased completely.

3276	zoloft	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	Patient experienced no treatment benefits.	The major side effect was persistent thoughts of suicide - always by hanging. These thoughts developed after about three weeks of treatment and became more persistent as time went on. Patient stopped taking the medication after two months subsequently informing attending physician, who initially did not believe that medication could provoke that side effect in someone 50 years of age.	Treatment details are as described above.
2154	zyrtec	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Over the course of about three to four months of daily use, lifelong allergies started to decrease and then disappear altogether.	None for me, some of the possible side effects are dry nasal passages, nose bleeds, and it could keep you awake if you take it too close to bedtime, but I have not experienced any of those except for 2 or 3 nose bleeds over the course of six or seven years.	1 Tablet once per day, each day.  It takes 3-4 weeks of daily use to get the full benefits.

3954	prilosec	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	severe indigestion diagnosed as possible ulcer	Although I was meant to take these daily, I felt my condition had arisen mainly due to a major change in diet. Being someone who doesn't like to take drugs regularly I decided to use on an as needs basis, so I now take if I feel the regular need to burp and have the early signs of indegestion (i.e. a knotty feeling in the centre of my chest, below the breast bone.

509	pentasa	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	pentasa	Pentasa seems to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug, minimizing pain in my intestines/colon.  I have been close to remission for a couple of years now, and I attribute it primarily to the Pentasa.	I don't feel as though I have any discernible side-effects with Pentasa, but when paired with Purinethol I do have side effects such as extreme fatigue and headaches, leading me to believe the problem lies with the Purinethol. I do have intermittent constipation, which could be attributable to a number of factors in my life, but is also a side-effect of Pentasa. I also have mild headaches, muscle pain, and anxiety which are listed as possible side-effects with Pentasa, but to the best of my knowledge these symptoms were occuring prior to my starting Pentasa.  Perhaps the Pentasa exacerbates the problems, I don't know.  I know that I do worry about kidney problems, which is one of the more serious side-effects of this medicine.	"Twelve years ago I became ill with what was diagnosed two years later (!) as Crohn's disease.  I have used a variety of medications, ranging from more serious drugs (Prednisone, Remicade)to less ""harmful"" drugs (Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Asacol, etc.). I have been on the Pentasa for about 8 years, during which time I was using Purinethol for several years.  A year or so ago I weaned myself off of the Purinethol and remained on the highest dose of Pentasa for my weight, and I am doing well (knock on wood).  I have constipation issues as opposed to my previous diarrhea problems, which may be attributable to the Pentasa, and is manageable through diet and over-the-counter aids."
3699	effexor-xr	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	NONE!!!	EXTREME fatique. I was not able to function day to day activities. I spent 14-18 hours a day in bed.  My muscles, joints & bones ached. The depression was not relieved, which probably a result of the side effects. I came off the drug slowly ( with help of physician) and now I feel great. The depression is still a possibility but I will NEVER take an anti-depression drug again.  I choose to have therapy and ask for the support of my family & friends	"I was prescribed this medication when the medication I had been taking for 2 and a half years became ineffective. I was not informed of any side effects. Every time I went to my GP to discuss symptoms which I was worried about, they just patronised me.

I no longer take any medication for my condition and although I do not consider myself to be well, some of my symptoms have reduced. The others such as incontinence, dry skin, lack of natural seretions, I am just trying to live with or trying to find products which I hope will one day help me."
1695	retin-a-micro	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	to reduce/eliminate wrinkling	By using this treatment a minimum of every other day, I noted that the lines around the eyes (crows feet)were diminished greatly. Also, the skin tone feels tighter and my pores appear smaller. I have, at times, gone off of the cream for a few weeks at a time, particularly during the summmer when the Florida sun is at its most intense.	Initially, the skin has to get used to the treatment.  I experienced redness and moderate flaking in the first 2 weeks (at different intervals). However, the skin eventually becomes tolerant of the product.  There is still the periodic sloughing of dead skin cells; but that's okay because you'll have a fresh, healthy glow afterwards.	Retin A is a simple topical application to use.  I use it sparingly, minimum every other day, on my face and neck. I plan to continue using this product as part of my anti-aging regimine.
3967	norvasc	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypertension	Quick relief of hypertension, moving from 150/120 area down to 130/80 region.	Side effects were edema, buildup of fluids in the lower legs and feet. This progressed to the point that it was noticeable visually, and presented problems in wearing of shoes and mobility. Blood testing also indicated a drop in Potassium levels to a low point that concerned the primary physician.	Additional medication was needed to control the edema and the Potassium levels. Triamterene was effective in eliminating the edema. Oral Potassium and Liprosonil were needed to bring Potassium levels up to normal range.
2076	metformin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	metabolic disorder	Weight loss of over 10 pounds in 4 months, continuing weight loss at a gradual rate (need to lose 40 pounds total).  Complete curbing of sugar and carbohydrate cravings, increased appetite control, cessation of binge eating patterns.	Diarreha if I eat more sugar than I should, some abdominal cramping, again, only if I ate something I shouldn't have.	Began at 500 mg once daily, increased to 500 mg twice daily, then increased to 2000 mg (1000 mg twice daily).  I believe that the slow increase of the dosage helped control any negative side effects.  It took about 3 months to really start noticing a difference, but that could be due to the titrating schedule.  I am also trying to be more conscious of what I do eat and when, which is helping with the weight loss and appetite issues.
1769	citalopram	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	less tired, more optimistic, more energy, no more depression	sweating	I started taking Citalopram 2 yrs. ago for mild depression.  I started at a 20 mg pill once daily. I notice approx. 1 yr. later I was still SLIGHTLY depressed, so my Dr. prescribed I move up to 30 mg. I felt great.  In the fall, I noticed 'blue'. (S.A.D.  ?) So my Dr. again prescribed that I move up to 40 mg throughout the winter months to see if that helps with seasonal affective disorder, & that I can start to ween myself back down to 30mg shortly before spring. The only side effect I've noticed so far, has been some mild sweating durting the night that started when I started taking the 40mg. Other than that, I have loved the way I feel since I've been taking Citalopram.    So far so good.
2077	metformin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	metabolic syndrome x	Reduced AM fasting glucose	When first started taking the drug, patient experienced diarrhea.  Lowered the dose and then increased it gradually instead, also splitting it into one dose in the AM and one in the PM, and the side effects disappeared.	Patient had almost all the markers for Metabolic Syndrome X / Insulin Resistance.  Physician decided that Metformin might be help the Syndome X, plus it would have the added benefit of keeping patients slightly elevated morning blood glucose levels more stable.  It is not clear that the drugs had a large effect on most of the Syndrome X symptoms, however patient has been on the drug for 8 years and it reduced the AM blood glucose levels to a normal level.
3331	tetracycline	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	The tetracycline helped to reduce acne lesions.	Tetracycline was heavy on the stomach and if you ask me added to yellowing of my teeth but that is a subjective view. Mostly it caused stomach gas and disturbance. I had constant vaginal yeast infections because (I believe) of the imbalance of good bacteria.	I was to use the drug daily for a period of 3 mo.
3165	prednisone	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ulcerative colitis	I never really had any complications with my disease. It seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. It also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has Ulcerative Colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. It really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. The side effects most likely worsened because I was on the drug for a long period of time.	I had dry eyes, trouble gaining weight, and loss of energy.	My doctor had me start out by taking 6 tablets a  day, three at breakfast and three at dinner. After 2 and a half months he had me start taking 4 tablets a day and 1/2 a pill less every week, until i was down to 1/2 a pill a day for a week. After that I stopped taking the pills.

Hung in there and pill started to decrease and finally eliminate anxiety.
187	adderall	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	add	Increased interest and enthusiasm in activities.	None noticeable.	Diagnosed with Adult ADD, I first took Ritalin. I found this to cause some 'nervousness' and to have peaks & valleys. I switched to Adderall XR and find I notice no physical symptoms, only an increase in positive mood and desire to accomplish the days work. The effect does seem to peak soon after the dose, slowly level out, and at about 6-8 hrs. after initial dose, I feel calm but now enthusiastic as earlier in the day.
4031	tri-luma	8	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	hyperpigmentation	lightening of acne scars	redness, dryness, breakdown of skin	this topical compound was used to reduce hyperpigmentation of skin.  the medication was suggested for nightly use but the adverse effects were too intense, and the drug could not be tolerated but few times per week for the duration of 8 weeks.
2861	soma	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	back pain	The pain in my back and neck caused stress and spasms. The medication relived the pain , nearly completlly, and allowed the spasms to subside. I tried anti inflamatories before for this re occuring problem and found them to be nearly useless. Strong pain killers like darvocet and vicadin are affective but do not allow me to maintain any normal activity during the drug use.	I found that after two to three doses ther seems to be a cumulative affect of the drug on my sense of balance. This is very mild, and only leaves me feeling a bit light headed at times. I am still able to engage in most of my normal neccessary activities around my home. I do refrain from driving or any other possibly risky activity when on this medication. Also , when I have prolonged pain and require several days of medication, I have noticed slight constipation. This is no where near as bad as the constipation caused by vicoden or darvocet.	I suffered form damage to soft tissues on my neck and back from an accedent. i crashed on a mountain bike and after the inisial recovery period, I found that certain activited can cause a sharp pain in my back at the base of my neck. This, if not medicated, will grow in the course of a hours, into spasms and tense pain. It will cause me to contort my neck and everything I do brings more pain and discomfort. The medication when taken at the onset of the pain, cause the muscles to relax and the pain to subside in a day. If the pain becomes severe and medication is postponed, it may take several doses of medication over the next day or two to make the muscles relax.

437	imitrex	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	migraine	none	Within 30 minutes of taking my first dose of imitrex (on Christmas eve) when I felt the onset of my migraine, I began to feel a heavy, cramping feeling in my muscles like I had slept the wrong way. Then my back began to ache and my joints began to cramp up and throb. My chest felt heavy and I had trouble breathing and remembering to breath. My throat and neck hurt so back and it felt like i had strained it or pulled a muscle. My train of thought was messed up and I could not concentrate or form full comprehensive sentences. There was nothing I could do so I just waited it out, towards the end (nearly 4 hours later) I tried eating and my salivary glands went crazy! I felt like I was drinking and eating scalding hot food, it was crazy! I will NEVER take that again. I called my doctor and she moved me immediately to MAXALT, IT IS GREAT, I LOVE IT. I have other allergies so it is no surprise to me that I had a reaction, but the severity was shocking. Don't settle for a medication that makes you feel only half good.	Took Imitrex for a 3 month period and still had no noticeable results.  The tablet was suppose to lessen the pressure and pain if taken at onset of migraine.  I ended up trying Aleve and still take it to this day for migraines.
1378	biaxin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection, bronchitis	Clearing of sinus infection and bronchitis.  Used a few times for same problem, sometimes after trial of azythromicin (which did nothing) or doxycycline which  also did very little.	Simply a bad taste in my mouth which can be eliminated, or nearly so, by frequent cleaning of teeth.	"""I too have had multiple sinus infections and surgery twice. In addition I am immunosuppressed because of a medication for rheumatoid arthritis. Biaxin has always worked for me. I really have no side effects other than the metallic taste which is tolerable. I make sure I take it after food otherwise it is really hard on the stomach. I take Biaxin XL 500mg, 2 tablets once a day for 14 days."""
1971	lyrica	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain	"patient slept better
patient had some decrease in pain"	"fatigue
patient felt tired.  this helped patient to sleep but prevented an increase in dose."	I took it 3 times daily to help reduce nerve pain from spinal compression that needs to be fused but I did not want another fusion yet so this was one of the medications they put me on when nuerontin at the levels I needed caused some of the same side effects as Lyrica;.
65	flexeril	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	back pain	I had very bad lower back pain with spasms and considerable swelling on my left side, to the extend that when standing, I was leaning to my right.  Flexeril took care of most of the pain and much of the swelling.	I felt much less alert -- not tired or sleepy, exactly, but sort of like inebriated, but without the buzz.	Once the swelling and discomfort were at a manageable level, I saw a chiropractor.  Although his ultrasound treatments weren't particularly effective, I greatly value the information he gave me relating to how I should sit, lie, stand, helpful exercises, etc.
1553	methotrexate	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	A reduction of inflamation in the joints on the hands, feet and elbow.

Use in the morning and evening in the spring allergy season. Continue to use even if symptoms disapear and 2 to 4 weeks prior to full blown allergy symptoms.

3526	lunesta	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	Lunesta helped me sleep the first few times I took them and gave me 5-6 hours of sleep without waking up every hour (like I normally do without taking it).	After taking it before bed, anything you drink or eat will taste metallic-like and that includes bottled water. Drinking a whole bottle of water with that metallic-taste made me vomit and that taste is still there when you wake up in the morning but goes away after you've been awake for 10-15 minutes. Occasionally, I will have hangover-like symptoms like feeling nauseated, depressed, and constant headaches all day long. If you miss one night, you will not be able to get any sleep at all. I've gone 72 hours without sleep once because I ran out and the pharmacy took forever to refill it. In the mornings when you wake up, you will need at least 4 cups of coffee to get out of bed. I've tried everything from reducing the dosage to sleeping earlier than normally and nothing helps to prevent that problem. All in all, not any fun.	Took 2mg for the first time ever (first ever sleep med) on an empty stomach and went to bed at 9:30 Got up at 11:30 and am typing this. I feel alitte sleepy (yawns) but it obviously did zip aliviate  onset insomnia.

2884	avita	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	aging wrinkles	I feel that my skin is smoother, and hopefully the wrinkles will not get deeper as quickly as not doing anything.	The side effects were mild.  Seemed to be a lot of skin flaking/peeling at first. I find a burning sensation if I am in direct sun so try and avoid that.	I applied this cream to my face every other day at night as recommended by my dermatologist who prescribed teh cream.  I noticed tightening up a few minutes after applying.  My skin did seem to look a bit better but I stopped suing the cream becasue I was afraid of any other possibly as yet unknown side effects.
2038	cozaar	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	blood pressure	Lower blood pressure		Cozaar, an angeotensin receptor blocker, lowered my blood pressure without side effects.
3157	prednisone	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nasal polyps	To reduce the inflammation of the nasal polyp. By doing so, this should allow me better breathing. I was experiencing sleeplessness, due to inability to breathe well and also to have to sleep in a propped up position. Following the steroid treatment, I was able to sleep well again without all the snoring.	Didn't experience any, except for first night a little restless, but that was it.	Following the steroids, I am going to have endoscopic sinus surgery to treat the blockages in my sinus passages.
1850	augmentin	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	sinusitis	Treatment quickly eliminated discomfort associated with the sinus infection.  These included ear ache, sore throat, and fever.  These symptoms were partially alleviated within 24 hours of the first dose.  Within 48 hours, all symptoms were no longer present.  However, the eliminated symptoms associated with the sinus infection were almost immediately replaced by negative side effects.	The treatment caused numerous side effects.  These included severe stomach cramping and nausea, a severe yeast infection, vomiting, diarrhea and chills.  These side effects began within approximately twelve to twenty four hours after first dose of augmentin was administered.  These side effects were intolerable and somewhat worse than the symptoms from the initial infection.	On medication for 2 weeks, 3X a day.  Infection cleared up about 2 days after I finished.
251	wellbutrin-xl	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major depressive disorder	I noticed at first with the 150mg a boost in energy, and more regular sleeping habits. At the 300mg upgrade shortly into month two I went from smoking a pack a day (25 cigarettes) to about 3. My boyfriend smokes also which is why I still have a few a day. Also after smoking pot it's nice to have a smoke I find.	Horrible dreams, not just randomly but every night. I wake up thinking the dreams are real and always have some sort of false emotion towards my boyfriend thinking he did something wrong. Although I know it's a dream I wake up with the feelings and emotions as if it all just happened. Also have had panic attacks in my dreams and woken up having actual panic attacks in real life. Also, I have read up alot about this drug because I like to know what I'm taking and what could happen... no one has said anything about how hungry you get an hour or so after taking it. I normally don't eat in the morning I haven't since I was 12. But after taking this the hunger pains are so extreme I am forced to eat in the morning when taking it.	So far so good, I will take crazy dreams every night for all the other benefits.
106	celebrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	pain	I am an athlete, tennis pro and avid golfer. I experienced inflammation and swelling post knee surgery (tibia plateau fracture). Walking an 18 hole golf course can be painful for me, even after a year post surgery, I was in search of pain relief to continue playing a sport I love. Celebrex reduced my inflammation and stiffness and allowed me to play pain free.	So far I have experienced no side effects. I have had no bad or serious reactions. I have not had any intestinal pains, diarhhea or nausea that I have heard are common side effects that are associated with taking this drug. I have not even had an upset stomach.	I have been taking Celebrex now for over five months. I am very pleased with the drug it has helped to relieve my stiffness and pain with no bad side effects. I was concerned about taking this drug on a daily basis or extended term but my experience with no side effects has lowered my concern. I will continue to take it as I do see a difference when I don't, my knee is more stiff and difficult to walk at times. I have tried naproxen but for me celebrex works better.
3758	spironolactone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	It greatly reduced acne from moderate, sometimes painful breakouts to rare mild acne without any side effects. It even made body hair more fine and the need for shaving legs, etc was decreased.	There were none. NO skin iritation, sun sensitivy or dryness as with other acne treatments.	Spironolactone was prescribed to me for PCOS.  I had hirsutism and acne due to high androgen levels.  The spironolactone helped reduce my androgen levels.  My skin is almost entirely clear and the hair is growing much more slowly now.
2575	klonopin	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	The drug worked exactly as prescribed; my anxiety was reduced. Heart palpitations were lessened in frequency and running thoughts were ceased. I was able to fall asleep more quickly because I wasn't as consumed by worries. In fact, I found myself able to do things that before I wasn't able of doing, like having conversations with irritating family members.	I felt very depressed on the days after I'd taken the medicine. The anxiety was always replaced with depression.	I was given a RX and I took one pill once a day for three months. I then stopped treatment because I realized I would rather have a good amount of anxiety than be depressed walking around. I have anxiety, but I'm a basically happy person.
2030	protonix	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	gastrointestinal disorder	none	On the first occasion I took this drug, I experienced mild tingling and redness of my hands and feet and face. I became somewhat week and faint like . I did not, at the time tie these reactions to the medecation. When I took it on a seperate occasion I experienced extreme tingling, redness and diarea and had to be transported to the hospital where they treated me for toxic shock.  passed out	Benadril, allegra and other intravenious medication I am not sure of.
89	pristiq	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	No side effects, other anti-depresson pills usually made me stop taking them because of the side effects, but Prestiq had none. I actually felt better after taking my pill, I was more bubbly and felt like my old self. I was also less aggravated and could think more clearly.	I did not have any bad side effects. The only bad thing I can say about Prestiq is it is expensive about $50 a month even with insurance. There is no generic as of yet.	"""I started taking this medication in conjunction with Lamictal.  Although it is not recommended, my psychiatrist suggested for the first few days I cut the 50mg tablet in half.  I am glad I did.  After reading everyone&#039;s reviews about the stomach upset and headaches, I decided it might be beneficial.  I took 25mg for about 6 days then upped to 50mg.  I had slight stomach upset and a few mild headaches.  I take it as soon as I wake no later than 8am.  I have seen a huge reduction in my appetite.  I was a binge eater of sweets before I started and at 5&#039;3&#039; weighed in at 150lbs.  In three weeks I have lost 4lbs.  This is the most stable I have been since I can remember."""
81	ventolin-hfa	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	I have had asthma for years and take albuterol.  I heard about this new inhaler from a physician at work. He stated that it was a more pure form of the drug.  At the time he stated it was expensive to get. At the same time we were finding out that albuterol was being discontinued.  The replacement had a horrible taste to it. My son who has severe asthma was even refusing to take the new inhalor. I asked my physician for it specifically at my next visit. He did not hesitate to provide me the prescription.  My insurance company doesn't pay much of anything so I worried they would not cover it and they did.  I was very happy that it worked so well with no funny taste.	none	two puffs as needed every four hours.  I have taken albuteral and it does help but this is awesome. It works within seconds and you don't get shaky
2953	zyban	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	smoking	I gave up smoking fo four months after taking Zyban for 10 weeks	Zyban made me not care about smoking, it also made me not care about anything else, not exactly depressed - just nothing seemed worthwhle.	I took Zyban for 10 days before my quit day, then quit smoking and continued with the Zyban for a further 8 weeks. During that time I smoked on three or four occasions, mostly part of my husband's cigarette. I was really pleased with how I had done, and thought I had finally managed to kick the habit. But on holiday with a lot of smokers I gave in and smoked, thinking I would stop again when I got home - unfortunately that didn't happen.
3542	vivelle-dot	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hysterectomy	The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  I love this medication.	The only side effect I have experienced is that the patch leaves sticky stuff on your skin.  The adhesive can be very difficult to remove.	"""I had ovarian cancer and had an oopherectomy, my oncologist wanted me to use this drug for at least 10 years, started with higher dose and have gone down to 0.05, have tried dropping it to 0.025, but noticed I was having the hot flashes and lack of sleep at night, gone back to the 0.05 and enjoy it so much more, although I am now going on my 12th year of taking it. Trying to wean off of it but without the ovaries it is hard. Love this patch!!"""
3530	lunesta	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	trouble sleeping	Slept through the whole night. Did not even get up to use the rest room.	Bad Nightmares, Woke up feeling groggy, irritable the whole day, throwing up, general feeling of sickness. Ruined my whole day.	"""Had no effect on me at all.  I had an average of 3 hours of sleep after using it for a week."""
2964	niaspan	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high lpa	"Niaspan definitely works to lower lpa.  I understand that high lpa cause plaque build up in the arteries.  According to my cardiologist, high levels of lpa cause ""skinny people to have heart attacks"".  My levels were in the 70's and the normal range ends at 30.  After taking Niaspan for a few weeks, my lpa was within normal limits."	Flushing with skin burning was the main side effect of taking 1000 mg of Niapsan per day.  The cardiologist suggested taking a baby aspirin one halp hour before taking the Niaspan.  This does eliminate most of the flushing side effects and skin burning.  I highly recommend everyone with a family history of heart problems to get a blood test for lpa.	I observe a strict Atkins Diet, with regular supplements of a good iron-free multivitamin, calcium citrate-malate, fish oil, glucosamine/chondroitin and coenzyme Q-10. Liberal use of Morton Lite Salt provides good potassium supplementation. I also use a psyllium-husk fiber supplement to consume  7g of soluable fiber daily in 3 doses, which by itself had significantly lowered my LDL and total cholesterol prior to commencing Niaspan ER therapy. I've been exercising on an elliptical ski machine for 30 mins twice per day, burning  1000 calories, and have lost  50 lbs over the last six months.
2945	mirapex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	restless legs syndrome	My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies.	I've heard that some people turn into gamblers.  Not a joke.  But I have never had any abnormal urges to gamble while taking it.  I am not a gambling person. In fact the medication has never made me want to do anything wrong or strange and I've never had trouble or side effects at all unless I suddenly stop taking it and then I can't sit still or sleep becuase I am jumping around.	I take a .25mg tablet every a.m. and then around dinner I take another one.  This keeps me from becoming jumpy in the daytime because I used to just be sitting there and my arm or leg would fly up or I'd feel the need to move.  I also take 1 mg at bedtime to stop my legs and arms from jumping in my sleep.  This has improved my quality of sleep immensely.
3407	proscar	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	hair loss	I noticed hair regrowth in small amounts but did not know my genitals were shrinking.  A friend told me of his testicles shrinking on the drug and so I examined myself and realized that what once was, was no more.	Testiclular Atrophy (permenent shrinkage). I actually have one testicle now smaller than the other.  I pray everyday that the pain will go away and that my buddies will come back but I dont think they will.  As for penile shrinkage, imagine a button on a sweater.  This drug is poison and Im looking for a class action suit.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!!	1mg a day
1371	biaxin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major sinus infection	Within the first few days, could tell a dramatic difference in my sinus infection clearing up.  After the full two week dosage, 98% better!	Weird taste in mouth, almost like a metallic taste.  Also, severe yeast infection.	Just dealth with the awkward taste.  Took over the counter suppositories for the yeast infection.
3974	norvasc	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	Lowered his blood pressure with one pill to the point of passing out, and having severe cramping.	"One does dropped his blood pressure so low that it was necessary to have him hospitalized for kidney malfunction. It caused severe cramping of the intestines due to lack of blood flow. At admittance to the ER, he was put on IV to increase the blood preassure. The doctors did not believe that the Norvasc could have a severe effect because the Lisinopril, which ordinarily is the medication that causes severe reactions, did not effect his blood pressure. The one Norvasc pill caused his blood pressure to go from 185/109 to 64/43. It is important for all doctors to realize that while drug testing can give you the general reaction of most people; it is imperative to be conscious that some patients will react in a completely unexpected way. This is a situation where the man's experience with opposite reactions to caffeine, and other ""uppers"" to the norm would have given some indication that his reactions to medications can be contra-indicated."	Post emergency, the doctors felt that the reaction had to be caused by something else other than the Norvasc. They tested for urethral artery narrowing, kidney malfunction, etc. with all tests coming out normal. It was finally determined that the patients reaction to this medication was unusual, and the medication should not be repeated.
857	valium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety, panic disorder	I was given valium to calm me down as I couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.  It helped me cope with the stresses of every day life but also the stresses caused by my anxiety and panic disorder.  I think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed I find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things I wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  I get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. I feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.  However it does make me feel a little sleepy for about half an hour after it starts working...which is actually a nice feeling when you're nervous and then I just feel relaxed.	I didn't have any side effects at all.  But it does make me sleepy for a little while in higher doses when it first starts working (YES, I can actually feel when it starts)	"""Amazing drug for anxiety. I don&#039;t find it addictive. Just great!"""
705	accutane	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	Finally clear skin and less oil!  Prior to accutane I HAD to wash my hair daily it was so oily  but now I easily an go a day or two.   My face and back were perfectly clear.	I would have spent my last $2 on lip balm, even if I hadn't eaten in a week!  Talk about dry and flaking!   Don't even THINK about waxing.  I didn't know that you couldn't wax (it was 12 years ago and there was less information about it then) it ripped my skin right off!  Scary.  About 4 ear after my first round I did another go with accutane because my acne had returned and now, 12 years later my skin is one again pretty bad.  Unfortunately not bad enough for accutane.  I mus say however, I have never been as bad as I was before my initial treatment and my back has stayed perfectly clear since then.	You have to really want it to get it!  For females it is a pain because you have to do two initial pregnancy tests and then continue ever month to get a refill.  They also monitor your blood for possible liver toxicity and your hdl levels.  It is one pill 2x daily.

3881	abilify	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar	I had severe depression with agitation and mixed-state bipolar hypomania. I was insomniac. I took abilify 5mg for 3 mos, and then I upped it to 10mg.	I became drowsy, however, with adequate sleep (10 hrs) there were no hangover effects, unlike zyprexa, for instance. I also experienced some cognitive blunting- that is to say that I could not think very well on my feet	the abilify decreased the need for daily klonopin. When I went off of it, I tapered down to 5mg for 4 weeks, then quit altogether. I had racing thoughts when I stopped, but these gradually diminished over several weeks. I also experienced about two months of hypomania, but this was goal-directed and positive for my functioning.

I wanted to go out in the world again, where as before I hid in my house because of panic attacks. I landscaped my whole garden and when that was done, I decided I wanted to work again and found a job. My marriage flourished after this new me and I fell pregnant 6 months later, at which time I had to discontinue, but that 6 months of Prozac was all it took to give me a new life.	"I experienced a loss of libido and inability to climax. 
Loss of appetite (a GOOD side affect in my books! I lost quite a few kgs and it did wonders for my self esteem). 

I would NOT recommend taking this with alcohol, especially something like tequila which is an upper. Combined with alcohol I experienced wild abandon, loss of inhibitions and total change in personality, I am usually quite reserved, but became quite the opposite - which sorted the libido out, but still unable to climax."	My treatment involved psychotherapy as well as the medication.
2705	bisoprolol	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	palpitations	Immediately controled palpitations associated with mild to moderate mitral valve regurtitation	none	one time daily
2012	sonata	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Fell asleep easily without feeling drugged the next day.	None, but the drug didn't last long.  It guaranteed I'd get about 5 hours sleep, no more.	Was having chronic insomnia, but I wanted a very mild sleep aid as I need to be very alert in my workday. I was able to get myself into a good sleep pattern without any drug dependence.
135	valtrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	cold sores	If drug is taken at very first sign/symptom of cold sore, the drug will elliminate it within that day. If the cold sore has fully surfaced it will still help to speed healing (usually within a week). This medication is not a cure for cold sores.	I have not noticed any side effects and have been taking this drug for a couple of years. It is important to note, there is no cure for cold sores (herpes). I don't know how the drug works but it seems if I am run down over the course of several weeks I may have to take the drug several times to keep a cold sore from surfacing.	When you first feel a cold sore coming on take 4 pills with water, wait 10 to 12 hrs and then take another 4 pills. I have heard of people taking a daily maintenace dose that should ensure you never see a break out of blisters appearing, however, if not on a drug program, this would be very expensive, and depending on how many times you tend to break out, probably not necessary.
2670	prinivil	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	It did lower my BP some	I'm not sure if the drugs did this, but I have severe tinnitus now, and it's driving me crazy!	I take 1 tablet per day, first thing in the morning.
1953	lyrica	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	Lyrica has made a huge difference with my fibromyalgia pain. I have had fibromyalgia for 13 plus years and was excited about the FDA finally approving Lyrica for fibromyalgia patients.  I would recomend that anyone suffering from fibromyalgia try this medication, along with a healthy diet and exercise. Lyrica is not a cure, but I have improved probably 75% over this last year.	"It took my body 3-4 weeks to get used to Lyrica.  It did make me feel a little different ""high"" would probably be the best way to describe it.  I have since adjusted and have had no further side effects."	Started with 50 mg 2x a day (morning and afternoon), then gradually built up to 150mg 2x a day.
2824	wellbutrin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I experienced less depression, increased libido plus the added benefit of decreased desire for cigarettes.	I have a dry mouth and eyes. Drug has decreased effectiveness in last 5 years.	Prescribed at 300 mg per day, have taken as much 450 mg per day. I like this drug because it has few side effects.
4034	tri-luma	3	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	melasma	My melasma improved considerably, which speaks to the efficacy of the treament because I only used it for 7 days.	My skin started flaking all over my face (not just on the application sites). The flaking is similar to normal dry skin symptoms. I also developed very minor scabby areas below my eyes, just above the cheek application site. The corners of my mouth turned red and became irritated, which was annoying and unbecoming.	Was to apply Tri-Luma 3x per day to upper lip region with dermal melasma.  Treatment caused side effects that were very unbecoming and very uncomfortable, so I stopped application after two weeks of discomfort with no apparent results in the lightening of the melasma.
1312	enablex	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	bladder control	There were no benefits. Over-active bladder continued as is.	No side effects.	"Enablex was the 4th in a series of bladder control medications that I was
given over a 2 month period. It had no effect whatsoever on my condition."

The fatigue was overwhelming.  The Provigil is helping.
1758	topamax	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	My headaches have been considerably reduced; however, I still experience some mild headaches. The relief from my chronic and debilitating headaches has been a miracle thus far, and while I've had some pretty irritating side effects, I'm willing to put up with them so that I can live my life relatively pain free. I'm hoping the pain will pass.	Tingling of my tongue, toes, and fingers. Some speech issues, word finding issues, major spelling issues - especially when handwriting. This is especially interesting because I'm generally an excellent speller. Unfortunately I have not experienced the weight loss side effect.	Titrated up very, very slowly. Just recently reached my 100mgs, and have been on that for about a week. I'm hoping the weight loss will happen now that I've been on that for a week, just recently have lost my appetite. Interestingly enough, sodas don't taste all that bad to me, but I still don't really feel like having them.
591	zestoretic	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	After trying a variety of high blood pressure medicines my doctor prescribed Zestoretic.  Zestoretic lowered my blood pressure to acceptable levels of 100/70 from 130/90.  The difference between this medicine and prior ones seems to be the diuretic.  After experiencing the positive benefits of the diuretic I began watching my sodium intake.  I avoid any food that contains 900 or over mgs of sodium per serving.  This pretty much eliminates most canned soups, dry packaged side dishes and frozen foods.  After 16 months of watching my sodium intake I have become much more sensitive to sodium and no longer use table salt		I take two tablets once a day at breakfast.
233	wellbutrin-xl	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The drug caused the depression to recede to the point that I was able to function normally. The libido lowering effects of a prior antidepressent (SSRI) were alleviated completely. I was able to lose excess weight gained during treatment with the other SSRI	Occasionally I would have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep if I took the drug too late in the day. I began to take it upon wakening daily to counter those effects.	I took one tablet per day 300 mg of the Wellbutrin XL.
2205	advair-diskus	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	asthma	I am able to breath more easily. Taking the medication keeps my airways open and keeps me alive.	More easy bruising than when not on the medication. This isn't a big deal.	Was given the inhaler due bronchitis.  It seemed effective along with antibiotics.  I am now breathing fine and have no symptoms of asthma or bronchitis.  This was 3 weeks ago.
4050	amoxil	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	ear infection	Not many. But it helped numb the pain and slightly make the redness fade away. It also helped me get to sleep and keep a scheduele.	Made me nasuous, dizzy, and tired. Gave me a headache and loss of appetite. All symtoms were affective immediatley after use	Chewable tablets. It was like chewing up an ibubrophen tablet with a teaspoon of Hawaiin Punch. Bleh! DO NOT TAKE
414	imitrex	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	"I initially switched over from Axert since my insurance covers more of the Imitrex prescription.  Imitrex just isn't right for me.  I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  Definitely going back to Axert!"	flushing, tingling, prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness and pounding heartbeat.	Take 1 tablet by mouth. Max 2 tabs per 24 hours.
1370	biaxin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection with smelly nasal discharge	It effectively treated my maxillary sinus infection.  No more smelly nasal discharge and I could see the result within the first day of taking this drug.	No major side effects I could tell except a constant mild headache that did not really bother much.	Simply take a pill twice a day, for 10 days

The dose was perfect for my condition.
Felt more calm and moods much better."	mild headache at the start, and loss of appetite.	My psychiatrist put me on a low dose in October 2009 (20mg) which increased to 40 mg in two months. I am now currently taking 50 mg and it is working great.
1838	yasmin	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control		Sore breasts, moodiness	I took this pill for 3 months at the exact same time each day and ending up getting pregnant. Looking back I am glad I did, because I can't imagine life without my Yasmin baby as we call him, but an unplanned prepnancy with a small child already was not fun.  I do not recommend.
2405	synthroid	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	s/p thyroidectomy	Treatment benefits consisted of weight gain after pronounced weight loss due to thyroid tumor.  Although the patient felt that there was a greater weight gain than she desired.	A greater than desired weight gain and a decrease in energy and libido are the most bothersome side effects as per the patient.  The dose is still being titrated in order to moderate these effects.	Post thyroidectomy, the patient was placed on Levothyroxin 120 mcg, but the patient complained of pronounced weight, lack of energy, lack of sex drive and some depression.  Blood work was done and the dose has been adjusted to 100 mcg and will be re-evalutated in 2 months.
1218	prozac	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	severe anxiety	This medication did not make me sedated or cause constipation like the last one I tried and I had no trouble getting to sleep at night.	On the first day of taking this medication, I became extremely high and anxious within an hour of taking it.  I then went on a major shopping spree, had major increased energy and talked a lot more then I usually do.  By the second night, I started crying and could not stop and my teeth would not stop chattering.  Over the next few days I became like a zombie during the day, but by night I would be a crying shaking mess.  On the last day of taking this medication I was truly suicidal and I was not even depressed when I started this medication a week earlier.  This medication was to treat severe anxiety only, and it did help for this, but made me severely depressed as a consequence.  This medication may be very beneficial for some people, but it did not work for me.	I have a long history of depression but had never taken medication for it.  I asked my doctor to prescribe Prozac.  For the first week I felt the same, but I slept almost 24/7 and barely ate. After that I did get a significant relief from the depression.  Unfortunately, as I noted above, I don't like the way I acted during that time, and still cringe with embarassment and/or regret over things I said and did.  But at the time everything seemed so rosy, that none of my behavior bothered me.  Unfortunately, life is not perfect, and as adults we must take things seriously and deal with them.  Prozac kept me from acknowledging that.  Looking back, if I had faced my depression head on, and let it inspire me to make real changes in my life I would have been a lot better off in the long run.

1574	xanax	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	to help me sleep after having a rapid heartbeat ep	The drug helped relieve the anxiety from worrying about the sudden return of the rapid heartbeat episode that happened at work without warning and under no stress. I was worrying that it would occur again at night while alone or sleeping.	I noticed that after taking the drug for several days I became very irritable and short tempered.  The side effects stopped when I stopped taking the drug.  I have never taken it since. I stopped taking the drug after recalling a collegue of mine taking the drug after the death of her mother.  Her mood and personality changed to anger and paranoia as she was taking it for a long time.	Dr. suggested I take a lower dose to decrease the side effects but when I did that, I still cried during the stressful situations.

1498	metrogel	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rosacea	Sometimes lessoned redness	burning sensation on occasion	Several years ago I was diagnosed with rosacea.  Metrogel was prescribed by my family doctor.  At the time I had oily skin.  It was prescribed to be used 2 times a day.  I was also told to use Cetaphil cleanser.  My rosacea symptoms were redness, burning skin that felt hot to the touch.  I used the Metrogel religiously as prescribed.  For the first 2 weeks, it burned on contact.  I hated it.  After awhile my skin started calming down and I stopped using the Metrogel.  Everytime my skin flared up I would use it again.  I'm using it right now.  I can't really say if the Metrogel helped at all.  Sometimes I think it is very irritating but I'm told to use it when necessary. Redness is sometimes better after use, but I don't know if it the result of the Metrogel.  I would like to find something better out there.

"Slow production(over-concentration?)

Loss of appetite"	I returned to school mid-career when I saw the economy tanking. I was unable to grasp the rudiments (law, rigorous)despite many hours of studying and reading. During that time my father died, I was depressed and close to failing out. I went through therapy and asked about ADD meds. I took a test showing attention and memory lapses. Doc prescribed 60 mg. I could tell an immediate difference. My grades improved dramatically, which was specifically the result I wanted. I now take 70 mg and intend to until graduating and taking the big test in Oct. '11. After that, I hope to stop taking it. I am not certain that it is effective over 6 months. It seems that one might build up a tolerance to the effectiveness. This most recent semester, my memory seemed to be where it was before I started taking it, but I have not found out yet.
3689	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Helped ease depressed mood, less mood swings. Better overall sense of well being. I was not as emotional and life felt more managable. I didnt even notice its effects while on it. I have tried other antidepressants that made me feel disconnected and my mind was cloudy, also experienced weight gain. Effexor did not make me feel like I was on anything, it just worked in the background. I only noticed it effects once I quit, my emotions were stronger and all my senses seemed intensified.	Bad withdrawels upon quiting medication. Sexual side effects, My senses seemed dulled.	Took 75 mgs once daily for about three months, then wheened myself of it. Very difficult to do, had withdrawels that included nausua, crying, dizzyness, brain felt like it was short circuiting in a way. I had to lay in bed when I didnt take it for 2 days.

I eat one fish fillet or chicken breast/day, nothing else, now gaining 3-6 lbs./month!  Since I can't find a Dr. who will treat my T3 I'm ordering Cytomel online, from what I've read it's the ticket to eliminate hypo symptoms.  Shame on physicians who treat lab results rather than the patient.  I don't care what the numbers are, I still feel awful!	FAT	Doesn't work!  It's the T3!
278	xyrem	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia	For the first time in years I woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. I woke up feeling rested, awake, alert. Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me.	I had a moderate number of side effects that were bothersome but not serious: Oily skin and hair, acne was worse in the beginning, excessive night time sweating - i would wake up drenched every night, acid reflux - this was on and off - tension and anxiety was increased during waking hours. I had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug, rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother), I lost a few lbs and I could eat whatever and not gain much weight. My testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy, but high enough to grow more body hair in places I didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. I also had problems with short term memory, though I did before when I was in a fibro-fog too. So off the medicine I have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.  It is a shame because i used to have a great memory.	I would take 3 gms before bed. Wake up 2.50 to 4 hrs later for second dose.  It was easy to wake up, many times I would wake up on my own. Sometimes I would try to wake up too early and would just sleep through my alarm and then wake up closer to the 4 hr mark. If I didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to 8 or more hrs of sleep every night. That was not always practical for me. I started off at the 3 gms dose twice per night and never had to change. Sometimes, depending on the time of month I got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only 2.5 hrs later and get around 5 hrs of sleep a night. Depending on where it was with my cycle, sometimes I couldn't wake up so I would lessen my second dose to 2.25 gms so I could wake up at 4 hrs after the dose.
1996	vicodin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	cesarean	I chose to take vicodin instead of an ibuprofin based pain killer because my holistic doctor believes ibuprofin  slows healing time. For me, vicodin has literally no noticable side effects, of course I only took a limited amount for acute pain, which was relieved 100%.	I felt no palpable side effects. I also was very cautious to take no more than what I needed, not only because it can be habit forming but because it can cause constipation which was the last thing I wanted!	I was instructed to take every eight hours however I found that I only needed a half pill and subsequently only took three pills, actually I took two and a half and stoll felt no pain.
1416	adipex-p	10	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	weightloss	I lost 40lbs the first time I took it in only 2 months and kept it off for 1 year. I gained 20lbs back after that.

I've done this three times now even with an extensive workout routine and very healthy eating habits.	Major mood swings, dry mouth, insomnia, facial twitching and jitters. The first time I took it I had thoughts of suicide that I had never experienced before but I was taking more than prescribed...not recomended.	I was given this drug to help lose weight, it worked perfect other than it was very costly and very few doctors prescibe it.

823	zyrtec-d	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Zyrtec D helped me live almost symptom free every day. Only during the fall when the ragweed count was exceptionally high (my worst allergy by far), did I feel some mild symptoms of allergies. No other medication has so effectively eliminated my symptoms on a consistent basis.	While taking Zyrtec D I often had dry mouth, and just couldn't drink enough water and was occasionally drowsy.	Take one pill every 12 hours, although on more mild days I could get away with only taking one a day.
3379	lipitor	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesterol	It did lower my cholesterol slightly, but that may have also been du to a change in my diet.	I had quite a few side effects, which is why I discontinued using it and switched to a natural remedy.  Some of the side effects I experienced included chronic constipation, difficulty digesting food and sporadic stomach pain.  I found it difficult to enjoy eating food as I often felt a heavy feeling in my stomach after meals which was very unpleasant.	A standard treatment with lipitor was followed with regular visits to doctor for checkup.
742	flonase	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus congestion / allergies	My dry cough and sinus infections were virtually eliminated.	some light nasal bleeding and a dry mouth when not taken precisely as directed.  It's important not to let the medication go too far into the nasal passage so that it doesn't go down the back of the throat which will lead to dry mouth.	I would do 2 sprays in each nostril once a day.  It would take about 36 hours to start feeling the benefit and about 3 days to get the full benefit.
2887	avita	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rhytids	Decrease in rhytids. Reduction in blackheads, congestion.	increased dryness, exfoliation. Especially peri-oral Increased photosensitivity.	Product was used in the OBAGI system and mixed with hydroquinone 4% in a 1:1 ratio nightly. Before bedtime.

No longer feel the need to just stay at home bymyself. No longer want to leave work because of depressed moods.	First 2 days wicked nasea. I do sweat more than usual. Trouble sleeping at times.	The patient took the drug in the morning with breakfast.
4144	percocet	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	foot surgery	I waited about 12 hours after surgery - till incision began to hurt - before I took the drug. It might have been move effective if I had taken it before pain started. As it was, it took about two hours to get relief.	Main effects were nausea, light headedness and room spining.	Drug prescribed for pain after surgery.  If I had taken  drug a few hours after surgery, anticipating the incision might be become painful, the outcome might have been different. Because I waited, I took one pill about 9 p.m., another about 11 p.m. and it was not until midnight that I got any relief.  The next morning, I was nauseous and and light headed. I don't take any medication, so the impact of the drug in my system  was noticeable and not pleasant. On second day after surgery, I took a couple of Advil.  After that,  nothing.
1067	botox	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	for wrinkle (line) reduction	Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details.	Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.	"The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye. Within 2 hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  The forehead was totally stiff. Upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted. The nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the 100unit vial)because it would be instable after 4 hours.    
   Since this time, I have had 50units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  There was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  The 100 units and 50 units lasted about 4-5 months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   I recently had only 10 units injected mid-upper forehead in 2-3 injections. Upon raising my eyebrows I needed (I thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  After one month, I find that I have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.
  My MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians, agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available, and they are only injecting 1 client, what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled."
3056	seroquel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe insomnia	Seroquel knocks you out, but for me it takes about 2 hours to start working. I take it about 2.5 hours before I actually want to get to sleep, and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. I rarely remember dreams. Seroquel has an amazing ability to erase memories of the day before, which for me is usually a good thing. Highly recommended for people with severe insomnia and/or rapid mood swings.	Weight gain and some grogginess in the morning. I am no longer a size 10, but I'm okay with it because sleep keeps me sane.	I take one 100mg tablet about 2 hours before I go to bed (I have a slow metabolism).  I allow about 30 minutes in the morning to wake up and be functional before I leave for work or school. I usually hit the snooze button about 3 times.
3503	maxalt	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraines	This is the best migraine medication on the market. Imitrex no longer works for me. I cannot be without maxalt or I will be in the ER. When I took Imitrex, I would have to repeat the dosage every 8-10 hours for 3 days. But, with Maxalt, I take one dose and it lasts for the whole migraine and I never have to take another dose until the next migraine.	no side effects	"LOVE THIS MEDICATION

"I seemed to metabolized the drug quickly. Onset was rapid and anxiety producing. The extended release did  not work for me. I was tried on a variety of doses, from several small doses through out the day, with minimal effectiveness, to several higher doses per day, up to 20mg 3x a day in combination with Xanax to decrease the anxiety. I was not prescribed Xanax prior to the higher doses of Ritalin. That combination worked better than the previous, but I felt drugged out a lot. So my doctor put me on 20 mg at 6am, and noon, with a small 5-10mg dose in the evening, and Xanax only as needed. I learned to live with the anxiety and work around it. I planned my doses where the onset(1 hour) would occur when I was alone or in only with a small group of people. I had to plan everything around the Ritalin to survive with the anxiety, but it was very difficult. But it was the only way I could keep a job. Without the Ritalin I was unable to concentrate enough at work to remain employed. 

Eventually my doctor retired, and I went to a psychiatrist who has ADHD himself, and he prescribes Adderall, 20mg early morning and noon, and 10 mg mid  afternoon.  The sustained release doesn't work well overall for me. My focus isn't as strong as it was on Ritalin, but there is no problem with anxiety, and I don't need the Xanax."
524	requip	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rls	I was finally able to get the deep sleep that I needed to function. Other problems that I have- Interstitial Cystitis, Fibromyalgia, Insomnia, etc.- seem to be improving because of the sleep that I am getting.	I seem to have periods of vomiting that last for several days. It happens monthly and I really am not sure what interacts with medicine those days and not the others. I did build up to my dosage .25mg every 3 days to try and limit the effects.	I take the medicine about 30 minutes before I go to bed because I only get about 4-6 hours of relief.
1974	lyrica	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia and myofacial pain	Nerve pain and muscle pain decreased significantly within the first couple days.  Fibromyalgia was very debilitating for me but with Lyrica, I was able to go back to work and function normally.  It helped with pins and needles, twitching, and muscle spasms.  It also seemed to help with some of the anxiety I experienced.	Constipation mainly.  I didn't gain or lose weight.  A little dry eyes and mouth.  I did have several colds the second year so it may have lowered my immunity.  These side affects was worth the benefits for me	I was first given 75 mg once a day and realized the medicine didn't last 24 hours so I started on twice daily doses and that helped.  I needed a little more pain reliever and started Tramadol along with the Lyrica.  I would take extra Tramadol if necessary, which provided relief at times when pain spiked.

Experience drowsiness that should not have been present.  I had to take this tablet daily for it to be effective and since I noticed the drowsiness in the daytime that I found impairing, I decided to switch to nigth time.	I had mild to moderate allergic reactions to environmental stimuli such as pollen, mold, mildew, dust mites.   In addition to using dust proof casings on my bed and avoiding areas where mold and mildew were apparent,t he zyrtec really assisted in helping me feel relatively symptom free.  Some of the symptoms I typically had were itchy watery eyes, congestion and occasionally rashes.  In some extreme cases, the rashes were extreme as in hives.

2336	propecia	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hairloss	The benefits of taking this drug were a slow down in mpb (male pattern baldness). I noticed that less hairs in the M shape were falling out. It also regrew some of the hair that was lost for several years ago in the crown area. I also noticed that thin, weak hairs regrew stronger and thicker.	Side effect were a feeling of tiredness and lowered libido. These side effects passed away after my body adapted to the lower DHT levels in the body.	"Propecia is a medication that is used to treat prostate cancer. It does inhibit DHT(dihydrotestosterone)that is the most potent form of testosterone. It also raises testosterone levels by 10%.

Propecia is also a treatment for male pattern baldness. DHT is known to bind to the receptor on the hair follicle. By doing this the hair will eventually die for those with genetic mpb. By using Propecia the DHT levels will be lowered, and you hair will not be affected as much as if you did not use propecia.

For hairloss Propecia should be taken as 1mg pr day."

This rash covered every inch of skin, causing swelled face and eyes.  Anti-histimines did not relieve.  Condition self relieved 2 weeks after stopping drug.	This was taken in case atrial fib resumed, in order to keep heart rate down.  Atrial fib did not return during drug treatment, so it is unknown if it would have help to keep heart rate down in the event of atrial fib.

I beleive I am taking the lowest dose and may have benefitted from switching to the more potent formula. I was cautious to do so as I was advised there may be considerable redness & peeling.	"Peeling skin, redness
Other than sperficial side effects, I did not notice anything else, nothing too uncomfortable. My skin seemes a little bit drier, which is why it was peeling..

Don't use more than this or you'll get peeling, redness and irritation.
1855	augmentin	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	sinusitis,quinsy	my throat was better.  My headache started to pass away quite fast. At the end of the third day, with the help of the other medication I took during the treatment, I was healthy and could go to work.	It was really hard for me to fall asleep during the treatment. And I felt dizzy. My sister had also taken Augmentin (22 years old),  but she had to stop using it after the first tablet because her skin was red and puffy all over. It lasted for 4 days.	I was taking 2 1000 mg tablets a tablets a day . I was also taking Clarinase to releave congestion  . The insomnia like side effects I encountered may be because of clarinase.
2190	clonazepam	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nerve damage, 1 nerve near mouth during surgery	It reduced the tingling sensation, and numbness feeling in the effected part,it also acted on reducing stress levels. I found it as a last resort because for 3 years before that my life was very painful cause of the nerve damage, that I suffered during a Mucocele removal. I took the anti anxiety drug for 2 years and its side effect that it blocks nerve communication helped a lot, and thx god after 5 years i am cured, my nerve healed.	It was hard to discontinue, I had to quater the tablets, and take 3/4, for 2 weeks, then 1/2 for 2 weeks  then 1/4 for a week before i could get out of it.	I took 1mg at night (up from an initial 1/2 mg dose) before bed as a treatment for sleep walking/talking and the inability to progress to deep sleep. This medicine worked great at first, but after 6 months I was no longer seeing a benefit.  The doctor took me off of it for 2 weeks as a drug holiday to let my brain rest, and had to put me on another med during that time because I had terrible insomnia as a result of withdrawal (I have never had insomnia in my life).  I do have some short term memory problems, but overall saw a bigger benefit to feeling better and an increased quality of life to stop taking the drug.
526	requip	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	I took this medication to treat restless leg syndrome and it was very effective. It made me drowsy at first, but once I took it for a few weeks, it just made my legs stay still so I could sleep.  I was told it is the same medication prescribed for parkinsons patients, but at a much lower dose.  I did need to take a but more as time went on, but it was still effective.  Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it when I got pregnant, since it is a category c medication.	I did need to take more as time went on, and I experienced augmentation of the restless leg syndrome.  The symtpoms would begin earlier in the evening and I would try to take the medication sooner, because if I did not take it before the symptoms set in, it was much less effective and would take longer to work.  That was really the only unfortunate effect of the medication.	"""I have had leg pain for over 5 years now.  I have taken tramadol for the pain.  I never thought it was restless leg because I never felt like moving my legs, they just ached so bad in the morning when I woke up.  my doctor just added requip 2 days ago and it was amazing.  I slept past 5am and woke at 8am with NO LEG PAIN and didn&#039;t need my 2 tramadol!! unbelievable! I am so excited to possibly cut my tramadol dose down because I was always so tired on tramadol! Im hoping this will work for awhile.  My starting dose of requip is .25mg."""
3926	nexium	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	burning feeling in throat and chest	Reflux under control	Weight gain, skin rashes and mild headache.	Taking Nexium once a day in the morning on an empty stomach. the reflux symptom mostly  gone after 2 days. taking Nexium for one week notice weight gain (3 pounds) after 2 weeks gain 6 pounds even exercise more and eat less still gain weight. Quit taken Nexium for one week lost some weight (3 pounds) but refux symptom return. Start take Nexium again one a week doesn't help much. I tried so hard to loose weight and lost a lot and now I have to deal with weight gain because of reflux treatment pills.
3594	differin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Smoother and clearer skin, believe it may act as a Vitamin A derivative and promote faster cell turnover. My skin had less cystic boils and lesions, skin was less oily and seemed more resilient, but you have to be careful with the dose otherwise skin can become more sensitive, and sun block is recommended with this medication too.	Skin sensitivity can increase if you use too much of the product. When it says apply a thin layer, it means a very small amount - it goes a long way! For me this  was the only real side effect.	Treatment is simple - after cleansing the face gently, apply a thin layer of the Differin gel to the skin before applying anything else, in other words it should go underneath any moisturiser or any other product you are using so that it is in direct contact with the skin.
594	nitrofurantoin	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic cystitis	When I started using Macrodantin it helped for the releive of bladder infections and also the pain of chronic cystitis. After a few years the side effects became more and the effectiveness of the drug less. I started getting bladder infections more frequently while I was still on the drug.	The drug effected my lungs. I started coughing more. Today I am very sensitive to any products or chemicals,and cough a lot and struggle breathing. I had a skin rush and itching skin. My breast enlarged and lactated. Started getting anxiety.	I had a bladder operation, because of a default of my valves. I was born with the problem. Because of the valves not closing properly I developed a kidney stone. The docters had to remove the stone and I lost my kidney in the proses. After the operations my bladder became very sensitive. The docter prescribed bactroban everytime I got bladder infections. The infections did not go away. I started using Macrodantin. It worked for a few years, but later on I started getting infections even when I was on Macrodantin. The side effects got worse and I had to stop using it.

19	proquin-xr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	urinary tract infrection	No diarrhea and better drug efficacy.	None at all.  The person who previously reviewed had an allergic reaction.  That does NOT mean the drug doesn't work, that means she simply can't tolerate the medication.	"My father is in a wheelchair.  For those of you with handicapped family and friends, you know how difficult urinary tract infections can be.  Ciprofloxin was a major break through for UTI's.  Unfortunately, paralyzed men and women have trouble holding their bowel movements due to the ""dumping"" effect of cipro releasing directly into the gut.  Although not widely promoted just know that Proquin XR has truly changed my father's life.  Instead of being hospitalized once a year due to a UTI, he can now take Proquin XR and continue on with his normal daily life/work etc.  Proquin XR basically allows the body to metabolize more of the medication and this in turn makes the medication more efficacious.  In layman's terms, it works faster and more effectively.  If you have digestive issues due to cipro or any antibiotic, you seriously need to try this medication.  It has not only helped my father but has made my family's life much easier."
3431	tazorac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne, photoaging	This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.	Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.	The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream. There is a generic version available from an Indian manufacturer called Glenmark. Their product is called Tazret. It is virtually the same as the original.
339	neurontin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain relief for arthritis and sleep aid	This has enabled me to take half the amount of hydrocodone that I used to take.  The gabapentin potentiates the hydrocodone wonderfully.  It allows me to sleep better also.  It doesn't knock me out, just allows me to go to sleep when I want, dream, and wake up not groggy. I've also had fewer migraines since I've been on the gabapentin.	Very very mild and occasional dizziness, usually when used in combination with imitrex.	I take 100 mg three times a day, with hydrocodone, and three hundred mg at night before bed.
2439	wellbutrin-sr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The benefits of treatment were a lifting of depression, specifically as it relates to Wellbutrin, to elevate the ceiling of emotions. It also had a midly energizing effect.	Very occassionally a racing feeling if I took the two doses too close together.	I've used wellbutrin in combination with other anti-depressants, but it is usually the other one (Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor) that loses it's effect after time. Wellbutrin has remained consistently reliable and contributes to the livlier aspects of mood elevation for me.
2491	remeron	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, depression, panic attacks	Felt 'normal' rather than in a state of panic and anxiety. Thoughts were clearer and not racing. Felt calm and peaceful.	I was told patients can gain weight on it - i didn't. (apparently you eat more, that's where the extra weight comes from)....can make you tired, which for me is good, as i'm very hyperactive.	After trying many anti-depressants, anti-anxiety and panic drugs - sometimes alone, sometimes in combination, nothing really worked for years until i tried (and continue to use) Remeron. It has made a *world* of difference to me and my quality of life. Started out on 7.5 mg one per day - gradually increased it. Too much made me sleepy, but found a right balance. Wish i knew about the drug many many years ago.
4027	glucophage-xr	7	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	polycystic ovary syndrome	Less acne. It didn't disappear, though. And a regular menstrual cycle.	"Eye and skin photosensitivity to sunlight and artificial light (especially fluorescents).

2525	diflucan	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	yeast infection	Eliminate yeast infection	The yeast infection occurred after taking oral antibiotics.  After I took the first dose of Diflucan, I developed an itchy, raised, red, rough rash on both sides of my face and the yeast infection only moderately improved.  I took a second dose a week later and the same problem occurred.  After that incident I discontinued use.  The Diflucan never did resolve the yeast problem and for months after I continued to suffer from skin rashes that may or may not have been related.  Eventually the yeast problem went away by taking probiotics and an herbal Usnea tincture.	"""Diflucan caused me to break out with a rash in my face and on my arms, neck, and back within two days of starting it. Therefore I can&#039;t honestly rate its effectiveness so good luck."""
3804	cialis	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	erectile dysfunction	Increased confidence, more frequent sex, renewed intimacy with partner.	Blocked sinus, headaches and backpain. Cialis was prescribed to be taken before sex. Because the drug can be effective for up to 36 hours taking another pill even 24 hours later increased the side effects substantially.	"""My doctor prescribed me 5mg daily Cialis for BPH.  I took the medication the first night and got a terrible headache and muscular pains.  I kept taking the medication for 5 more days and I stopped due to the side effects.  I stopped taking any BPH meds for 3 days and I decided to give Cialis another try.  This time I took an Aleve Liquid Gel about 30 minutes before I took Cialis and I didn&#039;t have any side effects at all.  I took an Aleve for the next 4 days and then I quit taking that Aleve and haven&#039;t had any bad side effects at all.  I would encourage anyone that has trouble with this medication to give it a little time before giving up on it.  I&#039;m sure glad I did.  I starting noticing improvement in my BHP symptoms within a week."""

3698	effexor-xr	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I made a good recovery from a moderate depressive illness and I believe that maintenance therapy has prevented me from relapsing especially when i have been under additional stress .I only have to take it once per day. I have only had one increase in dosage from 75mg to 150 mg	Myoclonic jerks,paricularly when i am relaxed. I get these more often at night whilst in bed . Dry mouth .Sweating ,especially at night . Initially an occasional tachycardia . The worst side effect is withdrawal symptoms ,even if I miss one dose. These are 'headiness' like flu,nausea ,a really odd feeling . It goes after taking my normal dose within about 3 to 4 hours	I was clinically depressed about 8 years ago ,under alot of work based stress and looking after a young famiy,Eventually saw my GP who prescribed Venlafaxine &%mg which worked well. Some time later my mood dipped..I cant recall the details and the dose was increased . I have been unable to come off it . I tried Fluoxetine at one point but this was not nearly as eefective . I am waiting till I retire to withdraw because I cant afford to take time off work ..not financially,just becaue of my commitments
3648	retin-a	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fine lines	the cream did reduce fine lines but my skin peeled first so I only usie it oc.casionally now. I would use it, the skin would peel and the lines are slightly reduced. It also dries up blemishes	peeling, dryness, slight irritation. There weren't any serious side effects.  the packaging warns about sun exposure but I stay away from the sun so I did not have a reaction from the sun while using product.	I used this cream a few times a week at first and now I use it only occasionally. It is a moderately thick white cream that I applied only to target areas, frown lines, forehead, etc. Also applied to breakouts. The skin would peel slightly after a day or two and then new skin is revealed underneath. This is a very easy way to treat very fine lines.
2748	micardis	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high blood pressure	The drug Micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related.	I find when I am taking Micardis that I tend to be very tired and my libido is decreased.	"""I have been on Micardis 40mg then 80mg for the last 10 years. My blood pressure hovers around 140-150/90-95. I am 5&#039;11&quot; and weigh 105kg. I&#039;ve not had any major side effects that I can tell, but recently in the last 1 year when I turned 44, I started to experience insomnia. At first it was for a few days, then weeks. The longest bout of insomnia I had was 5 weeks where I couldn&#039;t sleep (tossing/turning) until 5-6am. Thereafter I could sleep for about 2 or 3 hours before I had to get up for work. I&#039;ve checked some medical websites and apparently telemisartan drugs like Micardis may cause insomnia."""
810	ambien	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Made me sleepy enough to shut down and go to bed, although it typically still took  me hours to get to sleep. The sleep that I got from this medication was deep and refreshing.	Extreme drowsiness the next morning/afternoon, dependence, slight headache.	I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember, as it is a symptom of my illness. I usually go to bed around 7 AM if at all, and I don't mind it usually, except when I have responsibilities the next day and I am unable to fulfill obligations due to exhaustion. The first few times I tried Ambien, my doctor prescribed me Ambien CR which is extended-release.. I was taking the 12.5 milligrams. This medication gave me extremely bad headaches and didn't really affect my sleeping pattern. I went back and asked her to prescribe me another dosage, and she gave me the lower 10 mg dosage, not extended release. This dosage makes me feel very groggy at night, and a little drugged out. I have noticed dependency issues developing with it, even in my short time taking it.
2793	wellbutrin	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Experienced significant mood improvement in 2 weeks, increasingly more apparent over time. Where other medications had not worked, or had adverse side effects, Wellbutrin did not. This after several years of trial and error with other anti-depressants.	No acute side effects were experienced.	Extreme depression over a period of 12 years, seemingly untreatable. Multiple medication combinations were tried via trial and error. These included Zyprexa, Effexor (induced mild mania over time), Paxil, Prozac, and others. These were prescibed by a series of psychiatrists over the dozen years or so. Patient has stabilized in the past three years and is relatively happy with hid mood levels and stability.
2998	restoril	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Allowed me to fall asleep and stay asleep for the first week.	Drowsiness during the day, drowsiness and disorientation during the night after taking the tablet.	I took one 10mg tablet every night and it was very effective for the first week or so. Then after the first week I found that one tablet wasn't very effective, I had trouble falling asleep and also woke up several times during the night. I took 2 tablets for the next few days and it worked well, but after that it wasn't working well anymore so I took 4 tablets one night. The sleep was very disturbed, I kept falling in and out of sleep all night, and felt extremely drowsy and disorientated. I discontinued the use of this drug immediately as I realized I had quickly built a tolerance to it and wasn't effective anymore, even with 40mg.
3302	zoloft	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I immediately felt my mood swings and irritability disappear and I became a nicer person again overnight. My partner noticed it immediately and I noitced it in myself. I havn't cried at all and  although I don't feel depressed it's more that all my feelings have been numbed! I feel that nothing affects me and that I am better able to cope day to day.	The main effects have been the chronic fatigue. Although I sleep fantastically each night I wake exhausted and spend the rest of the day feeling like I have a hang over. I have no energy all day and find that I don't want to do anything all day although I do wonder whether that is through no energy or motivation! Feeling so fatigued also makes you so low and depressed so thats no help in the long run.Also my libido completely disappeared especially in the early days although it is not fantastic now.	Although this has been by far the best treatment drug I have tried in terms of treating my depression and mood swings and irritability at the moment I have chosen to withdraw from the drug due to the chronic fatigue which was bringing me down and beginning to make me low in another way. I have been told by the professionals that I have a chemical inbalance and that I have to take the anti-depressants like a diabetic has to take their insulin but for the moment I have chosen to have a moment drug free to find out what sort of person I am! I suspect I will last only a few weeks. Of of all the drugs I have tried this has been by far been the most successful for me in treating the symptoms.
2804	wellbutrin	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	depression	I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.	"None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said, I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.  I haven't felt much difference."	"Once a month I see a psychiatrist, although I am ""in between"" doctors right now because my previous one left as they always seem to do.  I have been without a therapist for a while now, wanting to take a break from the time and monetary commitment  that therapy demands.  I am  beginning to think that now is a good time to go back to it.  I consider the jogging, yoga, healthy eating and vitamins I take to be a part of my treatment."
1922	zithromax	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinusitis	It is extremely, powerful antibiotic, which give immediate effect with in two hours.	nausea	"I take a 2 month course of Zithromax, half a tablet daily, about twice a year to alleviate exacerbations of chronic Pseudomonas Auriginosa chest infection associated with Cystic Fibrosis. It works excellently in conjunction with a 2 week course of nebulised tobramycin (Tobi) to reduce symptoms and decrease sputum production. I believe one of its main actions is its anti inflammatory effect. Also I believe that it inhibits the ability of Pseudomonas to stick to the lungs. This is a great weapon in the arsenal against CF. 

I hope this helps your research and look forward to receiving my Skin Care DIY pack. Thank you."
2944	mirapex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	First treatment in 50 years that helped the constant but elusive pain in my nervous system, causing me to sleep an hour or two at a time at best.  The pain is 100% gone when I take the mirapex ... back when I do not.	Can fall asleep at my desk or driving without much notice.  Reduced the amount I was taking from 200 mg to the 100mg.	"""Mirapex has worked like a miracle for me. I can go on long trips again without constant leg &quot;stretching/wiggling/massaging/exercising/deep-knee-bending&quot; to take away the terrible sensations in my legs!
I also do not &quot;twitch&quot; and &quot;kick&quot; in bed, like I used too."""
1952	lyrica	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	neuropathy / anklosing spondylytis	Lyrica reduced the pain associated with my anklosing spondylytis when other therapies had failed.  I had tingling, numbness, pain, and very limited movement in my arms and legs from A.S. after developing 6 moderate sized bone spurs on my cervical spine.  It was severely limiting my ability to have any sort of life.  I have tried almost every form of pain killer from OTC to narcotics with very limited effects.  Lyrica works differently and I find that I can be RELATIVELY pain free.  It does not totally eliminate the pain but what it does is make it bearable so that I can function.  I could take more of it according to my doctor but I am more comfortable taking the lowest possible dose.  I've noticed that I have no more tingling, very little numbness, and a greatly expanded range of motion without pain.  I highly recommend this drug!	"The treatment side effects are somewhat severe.  The first dose I took almost immediately knocked me out!  I was so out of it, loopy, sleepy, etc. that all I could do is sit around and then go to sleep! It didn't get better after a couple of doses and I originally stopped taking it.  My doctor helped me build up a tolerance by stepping up the dosage over a week or so.  That limited the side effects but I still find that if I miss a dose by even a couple of hours, I start going through withdrawal and start feeling AWFUL!  I don't feel better until I get the dose!  That is somewhat scary to me and keeps me from trying a higher dose but the benefits of having a ""normal"" life outweigh the side effects and I dont' know of any safer options to do that."	am not sure the benefits are worth the side effeects. has caused a terrible change in my life style. the relief from the pain is good enjoying but the side effects keep me from enjoying the things i love, i just want to lie on the couch and sleeping all the time and the depression is terrible even though i take an antideppressant
1452	cymbalta	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression, anxiety & pain	Stopped chest pain, heart palpitations and anxiety. Didn't work so well on the pain tho. Overall gave me a sense of well being and did not interfere with sex drive.	Mild dizziness, nausea that went away after about 2 weeks.	Have taken the cymbalta for a year and the results are great. In addition, I exercise 3x per week. Have tried all the other SSRI meds and they made me feel like a zombie.
2588	oxazepam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety due to relationship stress	I would get heart palpitations and major stress hours before my ex would come and pick up our daughter for visits; I also had difficulty sleeping if I had to deal with any issues with him; I would take one of these pills, only if I felt I needed and sometimes an hour before he would pick her up, and I would feel much calmer.  It was a life saver for  me until I got through the emotional upset and was able to detach.	Virtually no side effects, other than very slight drowsiness several hours after taking it...almost not noticeable.	I was on a very small dose.  And I only took this when I felt I needed it.  It was a life saver and kept my body from experiencing intense stress like shaking, heart palpitations, and emotional upset.  It did not change my mood.  It only controlled the negative physical effect that I was allowing this person to have on me.

3217	copaxone	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis	It reduces the frequency of episodes of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis.	The most common side effects are reactions at the injection site, which I have had, especially at the beginning of treatment. These are redness, a lump or firmness, soreness, or itching at the site of injection. Once I developed a permanent depression at an injection site, which is caused by a localized destruction of fat tissue. Some patients (I never have) develop a short term reaction experienced immediately after injecting this medicine. This reaction  includes a feeling of warmth and/or redness known as flushing, chest tightness or pain with heart palpatations, anxiety, and trouble breathing. These symptoms may last a few minutes then go away by themselves without any further problems. Each package of Copaxone contains a complete list of possible side effects, or you may obtain this list from your doctor or pharmacist.	"""I have been using Copaxone for almost ten years. In that time I have had maybe two flareups. I self inject. Found the auto inject hurt more. Skin irritation lasts less than half an hour. The only long term side effect is a loss of fat cells under the skin which cause slight indentations. I chose Copaxone after many hours of research and have never been sorry. I intend to continue using this drug until someone convinces me there is something better."""

2867	aldactone	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The Spironolactone has really helped my acne, especially the huge flare ups I'd have monthly with my period.  I do still occasionally have break outs, but they are usually less severe, shorter lasting, and confined to my face.	The main side effect I've had is irregular periods.  First it was annoying, not knowing when my period when come.  Then as my period became less frequent, it was actually kind of nice.  However, now I feel like about 15 or 20 days into my cycle I start to bloat like normal, but don;t start or get relief for about another thirty or so days.  So, now I kinda feel like it's bloating or acne to choose from.	I take two 50 mg spironolactone tablets each morning along with 50 mg od doxycycline.

I will have a difficult time awakening and getting myself moving.  Others tell me I look like a zombie!  So I know it's important to take the Rx w/in 15 minutes of lying awake in bed & not let too much time go by before I lose the 8 hours of sleeptime.	I have found the best way to take this medication (once I've had a few nights of my mind racing & not being able to fall asleep) is to take 30 mg. a half hour before bedtime which causes a drowsy feeling even before falling into bed.  A few ights of this procedure & my sleep cycle seems to get back on track & then I don't need the medication, until  another cycle of sleeplessness creeps into my life!

Have had great results with lexapro with only minimal side effects such as a small weight gain.	Would not recommend going off lexapro cold turkey as the effects of doing this are pretty horrible such as head spins, highly recommend slowly weaning yourself off it.  Have had a slight weight gain due to slowing me down considerably.	Doctor prescribed lexapro when I had seen him about black moods & depression which is something I have had on and off since I was very young.   Depression was starting to effect my family life so felt I needed to see a doctor, he prescribed me lexapro as it helps with depression & anxiety.  I was prescribed 10mg and take one tablet daily.  I visit the doctor regularly to update progress on lexapro
3643	retin-a	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	It cured my acne and reduced my wrinkles. This was really the best product I ever used. Common over the counter products and benzoyl didn't work, which was very frustrating. However, the effects are only temporary. As soon as I stop using it, after a few days I will get blackheads again.	I really did experience redness and flaking, like most users did. But that was mainly around the soft tissues, such as my mouth. So I decided to use it more on the trouble areas and less on the other parts. Side effects were reduced after combining with Jojoba Oil.	I applied a pea size every day. You really do have to wait 20 minutes after washing your face before applying, because otherwise you will really have an increase of the side effects. Then wait a bit longer to let it absorb and use a moisturizer which is non comedogenic, like jojoba oil. Worked fine for me! And I have very sensitve skin.

Amazingly unlike other sleep aid's I've taken, I didn't wake up groggy most of the time, the only time I did it only lasted about an hour. I did like the fact I didn't feel drugged half the next day.	One pill every night before I get ready for bed, treatment for insomnia.
2635	depo-provera	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hormonal imbalances and pregnancy prevention	After the first two shots I had no more periods until after being off Depo Provera for nearly 3 months. Also I didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong.	After getting off the shot it took nearly 2 years to get pregnant with our second child; however that was to be expected as it took over a year to get pregnant with my first (Depo was my first experience with birth control). There was mild weight gain, once I started dieting and exercising I was able to deal with it though. Some mild acne but nothing anyone besides me ever noticed.	This drug is administered into a muscle by injection four times a year, by a physician.  The shot is given every ten to thirteen weeks.  Besides being used as birth control, it is also used to treat other conditions.

Appetite seems to fluctuate, usually being low during the middle of the day and more normal by suppertime. Adequate amounts of food that is nutritional seem to be especially helpfull."	"I was told that in prescribing for an adult, special considerations are made. The adult may need less of the medication for his weight. A medication may have a longer ""half-life"" in an adult. We started with 19mg and worked up to 36mg. That seemed to be the correct dosage."
1483	cymbalta	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety/ pain	My pain and anxiety were considerably lower. I felt like any situation was controllable and I was much more effective at my daily tasks.  The panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle.	At first I seemed a bit hot. I sweat more often. Then I began not being able to handle any stress at all. I began feeling like I needed other aids to help me deal with everyday stress and I have never needed anything before. Then my stomach began to act up. I began having constipation or diarrhea constantly. Never normal. I began throwing up and now my stomach does not digest food well at all. I also was unable to sleep, severe insomnia. I chose to take myself off the medication because the stomach issues have completely taken over my life and causing major disability. The side effect have intensified so much that I cannot function daily. Severe dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and my mind has been having lapses. Sometimes I cannot get out of bed. It has been over a week.	60mg once a day. I took every morning.
964	sarafem	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	It kept me at a low-functioning level (work and occassional activities), which was an improvement for me.  It kept me functioning due to decreased depression.  I had taken it for a few years on and off before finally switching to another drug two days ago due to the drug becomming no longer effective.  When I was younger and the drug was new to me it was much more effective.	"Reduced libido
Stopped working after several years, even after dosage increases"	Started on 20 mg dose for 2 weeks, then increased to 40 mg.  After 4 months the benefits decreased dramatically so switched to another drug, bupropion, but still taking 20 mg of fluoxetine daily.
1092	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously, I had felt ""paralyzed,"" or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it, I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.)."	The only side effect I noticed was that if, for some reason, I forgot to take the effexor in the morning, by the evening I felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way.	"I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission."

291	panixine-disperdose	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	mild local skin infection	I cannot say whether this medication was or was not effective because I stopped taking it after 2 doses. I discontinued the medication because the side effects were severe and much worse than the condition prescribed for.	About 24 hours after my second dose I developed sudden acute abdominal pain. I have never had a negative reaction to any medication before, and had rarely had any stomach pain in my life. This pain was so strong and intense almost like the pain of a labor contraction. But alas it was upper abdominal and not coming from my uteris. It came in waves and anything I ate or drank made it worse. I was very close to going to the ER. But since my temp, BP and HR were normal and I did not have any other obvious symptoms I toughed it out with a heating pad and curse words. After 2 days of this torture I finally feel the worst is over. But I will not take this med again.	The initial skin infection is clearing up.
2557	levetiracetam	3	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	right temporal lobe epilepsy	In the beginning my seizures seemed to decrease, however at the time I was also on Depakote and Diamox as well as valium for right temporal lobe epilepsy; my doctor added keppra before he started weaning me off the depakote and diamox. I was feeling a lot better on all those meds. Then just the Keppra.	Side effects= Intermittent Headaches,weakness,shaky and Double Vision, poor muscle coordination, problem with movement, walking, Abnormal Gait, behavioral changes, anger,weight loss, slurred speech, & memory loss.	I started on Keppra in Feb. '09, at first I thought it was the miracle drug. Boy was I wrong! At the time I was also on Depakote, Diamox and valium. First the Doctor added Keppra and began weaning me off the Depakote ER 500mg pm. 250mg. am. It took awhile to get off Depakote because I kept having effects from being weaned off it after being on it for 25 years. Then a few months later he started to wean me off of diamox, which I stopped a week ago, after a long process of being weaned off that drug. Now on Keppra alone with valium, I feel horrible and no heip from my Neurologist. I feel completely alone and with no help in sight!
2581	lidex	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	dermatitis	The ointment kept the symptoms of the dermatitis(i.e. itching, scaling and cracking) to a minimum.  As long as the treatment was part of my daily regiment it was very effective.	"When I fell behind on the regular application of the ointment, the dermatitis would flare up within 2-3 days.  Unfortunately, the ointment fails to ""cure"" the problem and only treats the symptoms."	The application is very simple.  Just apply the ointment to the affected area(bottoms of my feet) twice a day.  The Dr. recommended I exfoliate the area regularly to remove any build-up of skin.  Following that recommendation I would use a pumice stone 4-5 times a week prior to applying the treatment.
3810	solodyn	2	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne	At first I started with the 65 mg dose for about a month and it really helped my skin. All acne was reduced. I think during this first month though is when I started to build up reactors and an allergy to this medication.	I went back to my dermatologist who recommended I take a stronger dosage which is when I took th 90 mg. After about 4 or 5 days I broke out in huge welts of hives. Very severe. I went to the urgent care unit and they prescribed me with steroids and zantac. The next day it just kept getting worse. My whole face itched then my lips got puffy over night. My arms are peeling and are swollen with hives. It spread throughout my body and with all the benedryl and steroids and zantac I've been taking, nothing seems to help! It's extremely irritating and I am miserable.	I am going to see the doctors again today because there is no improvement whatsoever.
415	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraines	I am so thankful for Imetrex. I have severe migraine headaches at leat 2 to 3 times a month. Before taking Imetrex my headaches would last 3 to 4 days. With Imetrex I can take the pill and my headache is gone within the hour. I have no side effects from the taking this medicine.		You can only take this medicine while not driving. You have to be able to go into a dark room and be able to lay for at least and hour and half. After that you are able to go back to normal living.
817	ambien	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	The Ambien did give me a solid nights rest. I did not experience the rapid effect that I've often read about, i.e. that I would fall asleep within 20 minutes even if I was in the middle of an activity. It usually took about 40 minutes to take effect.	After a while I seemed to notice that I was mildly 'groggy' for several hours after waking up. I was working at a garden center at the time and was frequently forgetting where I had left something. The joke was that I had my own private 'lost and found'.	Not sure what this means. I was prescribed this drug for insomnia which could have been menopausal related. I took the drug nightly for approximately two years. About half way thru this time I tried to quit but the insomnia returned so I continued. The second time I successfully quite and have not had a problem since that time.
985	tekturna	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension	Very well managed blood pressure within normal, healthy range.  I had an allergic reaction to a more common blood pressure medication, Lisinopril (which is a combination of a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor).  The newer Tekturna has worked perfectly for me with only the slightest dizziness when I rose too quickly early on, but no side effects at all after the first few weeks.	I had a very slight issue, early on in treatment (in the first few weeks only), of slight dizziness when rising quickly from either laying down or from bending over with my head down (such as when petting my cat when she was laying on the floor), but that fully resolved quite quickly. I have not had any other side effects at all.	I take one 300mg Tekturna per day, in the morning, along with 10mg of Terazosin (Hytrin) and my blood pressure is wonderfully under control. My last blood pressure reading was 110/66 which is perfect!

She had very few side effects and seemed less anxious. However, there was no noticeable change in cognitive function, which has deteriorated fairly rapidly, especially in the last 2 years.

1497	metrogel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne rosacea	I'd had dry skin on my face for several years which I'd controlled using moisturisers. About five years ago, I started to get acne pimples and bumps on my cheeks and forehead which was diagnosed as rosacea. I was prescribed Metrogel which cleared the problems, including the dry skin. Symptoms reduced almost immediately. I've had about two years without having to get a repeat prescription, and symptoms have just begun to return, so I've requested more from my doc.	The gel can be visible if applied too thickly, at which point it can flake slightly.	My dermatologist prescribed clindamycin first for rosacea. I experienced moderate results from the clindamycin but not a significant improvement and still had significant breakouts from rosacea triggers. Metrogel rapidly reduced the overall redness of my skin and significantly reduced the breakouts in severity and duration.
3567	differin	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	acne	There were little to no benefits to using differin to treat acne.  while it may have helped exfoliation, it did little to treat current and to prevent future acne.  instead of differin, using a separate skin exfoliation product in addition to an over the counter acne treatment might have been more beneficial.  My acne worsened using Differin -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  I don't know if I completely buy this theory though I would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  Unfortunately, it did not.	There were no side effects to the treatment except that it worsened my breakouts.  However, it did nothing to take down the flares even after three months of treatment.  Soon after I stopped using it, my skin improved.  So now, I choose to use an exfoliation product and a separate over the counter acne treatment product.	differin did not help prevent acne or get rid of current acne.  it worsened the condition though it was explained that as it helped the skin exfoliate, the impurities beneath the outer skin surfaced.  however, there were no improvements after three months of application.

3832	lumigan	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	longer eyelashes	The Lumigan made my lashes grown longer and thicker. I didn't need to use as much mascara.	I got itchy eyelids. The itching was fairly mild.	I put a drop of lumigan on an upside down teacup. Then I applied lumigan with a very fine artists type paintbrush. I would paint a thin line just above the lashes on top and just below the lashes on bottom. I would then use the remainder on my eyebrows. After about 6 weeks I noticed my lashes were longer and thicker. I washed the paintbrush carefully after each use and was careful to keep the line thin. After the first week, I began to use it every other night.
3814	solodyn	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.	I haven't taken Solodyn now for a week and I am experiencing very itchy skin, achy joints, and fatigue.  The itchy skin is mostly on my scalp and neck. Today I had itchy hives on my leg as well.  The joint pain is mostly in my right hand and wrist. It hurts to make a fist and then open my hand back up. I've had allergic reactions to other meds before, but they would stop when I stopped the medicine.  For some reason, these nasty side effects are lingering.	none

1665	climara	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hot flash sleep problems	My moods have improved dramatically.  I would wake at least 3 times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem), but now sleep is much better.  Hot flashes were intense and distracting, and have since stopped.  I originally took Premarin which gave me headaches.  The patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches.	The only drawback to using the patch is a mild allergy to the adhesive.  Sometimes the patch slips and has come off several times in the bath, so I've had to pull out a new one.  I do not like having to take progesterone separately in pill form, or at all, but with a uterus it is necessary.  I'm also concerned about long-term effects.	"I originally began using HRT 5 years ago to help with very severe menopausal symptoms.  I had tried all the natural remedies as I was very concerned about taking a medication:  herbs, soy, etc.  I walked 30 miles a week and did yoga, none of which helped.  In desperation I visited my OB GYN who suggested I go on HRT, stating that quality of life needed to be considered.  Shortly, thereafter, the reports initial study was released, and again I spoke to my doctor who said that she thought the results were over inflated.  I switched to estradiol because it's considered more effective, and the patch bypasses the liver with delivery directly through the skin.  I've since weaned myself off several times, only to have the symptoms return.  I'm concerned about latest studies and have thought about weaning myself off again, and then think, ""quality of life""."
2238	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	When my allergies were acting up and I took it, it helped within an hour. It cleared up my nose and throat and made breathing easier.	Drowsiness and I had trouble sleeping. Also the drowsiness carried over to the next morning so I felt run down all day.	When symptoms were bothering me I took it and it helped relitivily quickly.

I found it hard to stay at the 1500 range without severe flushing and itching and it would happen randomly no matter what even when i took aspirin and ate before taking.
Stopped for awhile and am now back on as my numbers have gone up again on bad Cholesterol and I do not want to take statins as I have no other makers yet for heart disease"

3325	tetracycline	2	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	This did help clear acne infections and helped skin somewhat improve	The side effects included sun sensitivity, upset stomach, tiredness	I was put on this medication by my pediatrician and, unfortunately, I think he did a poor job of following up on my treatment.  I think that antibiotics are too strong a treatment for acne.
206	elidel	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	skin rash	It was a cream base that was easy to apply, twice a day.  It seemed to help with an allergic skin rash due to detergent irritation.  It was not as strong as a higher dosage cortisone cream, but it was still effective.  There were no side effects of note.  The cost was higher than over the counter preparations.  All in all, it was a good choice for stubborn skin irritation issues.		The treatment consisted of applying the cream form of Pimecrolimus twice a day on the face for eczema treatment. The cream itself wore off very fast which limited how effective it acted. However, benefits were seen within the first week of use.
32	alprazolam	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	tinnitus	Treatment benefits were reduced anxiety caused by ringing in the ears sufficiently to allow rest and sleep.	Occasional daytime drowsiness, muscle and joint pain seemed more intense while on alprazolam.	"First I experienced the state of anxiety and panic at the age of 20. Starting with Librium I was successful to managed and control my mood and over sensitive nature.
Regular exercise, food and lively hobbies helped to relieve me form all sedative and tranquilizers.
It was, probably, job related stress and tension what triggered the state of anxiety and panic.
Now the above-mentioned medications are helping to perform my activities, mostly as a normal person."
3245	nuvaring	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	birth control		Within 2 months, I developed deep vein thrombosis in my left leg and pulmonary emboli in my lungs. Multiple blood clots in my lungs almost killed me. I was lucky to live because the clot lodged in parts of my lungs that were not fatal.	Insert for 3 weeks, remove for 1 week.
1802	oxycontin	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post-surgical pain	The pain was definitely reduced, from high discomfort to relatively low discomfort, so long as I wasn't moving. It also helped me to sleep some of the time.	During the second and third day, it seemed to increase my post-surgical nausea. Overall, in addition to drowsiness, I experienced a lot of dizziness. I'm not sure whether or not it affected my bowels returning to normal function.	At first I was given the oxycodone intravenously, with a button allowing me to choose when I wanted a dose (don't remember the amount) but limited in total amount and frequency (up to every 15 minutes, I think.) Afterwards, I took it in pill form. After several days I decided the side effects were too strong and  got a hydrocodone prescription, which had similar but more mild side effects. In retrospect, I wish that acupunture had been available; when I experienced an auricular 5-needle protocol several weeks later, I found the residual pain I had was immediately reduced, with none of the side effects.
1981	fiorinal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Fiorinal almost always gets rid of my migraine headaches.	Occasional drowsiness, though this is preferred as I usually need to lie down in a dark place when I have a migraine.	I'd typically take one Fiorinal capsule at the onset of a migraine headache, with water and sometimes salted crackers. (If I didn't catch it at the onset, the capsule generally had no effect).  I would then lie down in a quiet, dark room.  The pill would typically reduce the headache within 30-45 minutes.  Occasionally I would end up feeling sluggish afterwards - not sure if this was a result of the medication or the headache.  Regardless, it has worked well to reduce headache pain.
3582	differin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The patient saw effective acne control within 4 weeks.  She still had occasional acne lesions but saw clearing of most of the comedones.  Because there were few new acne lesions, the hyperpigmentation she got along with the acne was not happening, and the hydroquinone helped to clear the hyperpigmentation she already had.  At four weeks, her skin tone was even.	Dryness at the corners of the mouth was the major problem. I find if you apply moisturizer or a small amount of vaseline to the area prior to apply the Differin, the irritation will resolve quickly.	Medication is easy to use, and high patient satisfaction.
2433	symbicort	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	asthma/copd	Moderately helped control my asthma and COPD.	back pain, chest pain, headaches, distorted vision, thyroid problems, fast pounding heart beats, irregular heart rhythm, gave me a sinus arrhythmia	"""I was diagnosed with asthma and COPD and was given symbicort.

(GETTING TENSE DIDN'T HELP EITHER ;-) I had trouble laying quietly, let alone sleeping. My teeth chattered and my legs twitched like crazy and there was a very painful weak spot in my lower back. I still have the painful weak spot and pretty severe migraines, but this drug was a quality of life saver. When I took it at the same time as Topomax it was ESPECIALLY effective. I take 2 mg at night before bed, and sometimes another .5 or 1 mg during the day if symptoms were bad. It's exhausting to never be able to relax.
2559	inderal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	situational anxiety	I've used 40mg Inderal for situational anxiety a few times per month over the past 6 years. I found it to be very effective when taken 30min to 1hr prior to public speaking, large social gatherings, dates, and other anxiety provoking situations. It really helps decrease signs of nervousness resulting from the fight-or-flight response, such as increased heart rate, sweaty palms, and dry mouth.	none	as above
1102	effexor	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	helped the depression initially, was far more positive during the years I took it, but the efficacy of the drug began to deteriate, and the onset of new side effects led me to try to live without the treatment	initially, not many, some loss of concentration when driving longer than half hour periods, eyes felt very heavy, and it felt like part of my brain had shut down, struggled not to fall to sleep. after some time, about six years, I started to get night sweats, very uncomfortable, and mood swings. I thought it might be hormaonal, but after taking away the drug , the symptoms alleviated.	I now feel that I have suffered fibromyalgia for a long time, and part of the reason I was depressd was I found it hard to deal with the pain i was feeling at the time, I had two very young children , and was not diagnosed with a condition . If I had understood my condition better, I may have managed the fibromyalgia better. I was pushing my body too hard, as I felt frustrated t not managing everything better, and the cycle of depression continued. I have come off the venlafaxine, and the symptoms of pain, particularly in the morning have returned, but I can manage them better, knowing it is not symptomatic of a seriously damaging condition, and that it is 'normal' for me. I pace myself better, and no longer have the demands of very young children , so can do that easier. I like being 'drug' free, although I do supplement with fish oils and 5 HTP

I originally took Lamictal 200mg once a day for two months in March 2008 and had to stop because of moderate memory loss(mild long term loss and  moderate/severe short term loss), loss of ballence, and fatigue.I was sometimes in a mental fog. I would repeat the same things several times an hour and not remeber that I had said it. When I first started taking Lamictal I was leaving for college in a few months and my doctor(whom I no longer see)rushed me to raise my perscription very quickly.During that time it had completly controled my depression and mania.	I am currently taking it, and started taking it again in September 2009. I now take 150mg once a day. I have not had any side effects since I started taking it again in september.I partially believe that the reason it is so effective now is that I am 20 lbs heavier than I was when I first took Lamictal and because I now take a lower dose.
3652	retin-a	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult acne	Eliminated Acne with in weeks of first using. I continued to use as my skin texture had improved. Any time there was a pimple or acne outbreak I would apply to pimple more than once during the day and the pimple would leave. I also used on any cold sores and it elimated them in 2 days.	Some dryness and peeling around my nose and chin. Redness to my face the first two weeks.	Retin A gel applied nightly to face. Some initial redness and peeling the first 3 months. Elimated any existing acne and prevent any further acne.
1238	asacol	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ulcerative colitis	Flare-ups were less frequent as well and the duration of time they lasted was less. I noticed that it didn't help with the amount of bowl movements I was having but it did help stop the internal bleeding.	Nausea, cramping, abdominal pain were just some of the bigger side effects. Sometimes the stomach pain was so painful it was worse then an actual flare-up.	"""Asacol caused high diarrhea within 1- 2 days, then was switched to Colezol, and within about 2 months had a bad flare-up, which stopped within 2 days of discontinuing Colezol. Have since learned that if you are intolerant of Asacol, Colezol should not be prescribed. Are going to end up with same issues."""
2843	singulair	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	Singulair is very effective in keeping my asthmatic symptoms in control.  If I forget to take it, I can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about 36 hours after the last dose.  I will on occasion (maybe 1-2 times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol), but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  In fact, I have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since I started taking Singulair.	There are no apparent side effects of Singulair for me.	My asthma had become so bad that when I was to be administered a test where I would be exposed to irritants to guage the severity of my asthma, I did not even get past the saline control before my breathing was adversely affected.  I would say that my experience with Singulair has been superior (only surpassed  by Advair, which I had to stop using due to the fact that my insurance company wouldn't cover it anymore.  That led to my change to Singulair.)
2839	singulair	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	asthma	There were no benefits, only bad side effects in that the drug significantly worsened my ability to breath.	Shortness of breath, weakness.	Singulair was intended to address my Asthma and constant coughing due to allergic asthma; instead Singulair made my symptoms much worse.  Singulair significantly increased shortness of breath and fatigue--even during inactivity.  Due to the worsening of symptoms, I only took Singulair for two days.  Unfortunately, it took a few months before I was able to get back to my baseline (where I was prior to taking the drug).
2636	toradol	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain relief after surgery	I took this drug for pain relief due to surgery (laproscopically assisted hysterectomy). Although the pain I experienced wasn't great the drug did relieve it but the side effects were not worth it.	It's hard to know as I was swollen from the surgery but the drug's listed side effects are swelling if the torso, thighs, and legs. I was very swollen when I left the hospital and it didn't dissapate.	"""I had a awful reaction to this medication, while I was in the ER. I felt like my whole body was on fire and I wanted to crawl up the walls. It was giving to me because it is a none narcotic medication because I am allergic to a lot of the stronger pain medication&#039;s. This is one more I can add to my list of adverse reaction."""
2929	tramadol	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	back pain/depression	I first started taking Tramadol when a doctor prescribed it for some back pain I had been experiencing.  But then I continued to take it because it really relieved my depression.  It is a great mood enhancer and I have had a lot more energy and enthusiasm since taking it.	I haven't experience any side effects	I take two 50 mg caps per day
324	ativan	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	Calm me down, helped me sleep, did not wake up a lot during the night, able to handle stressfull situations.  This has be great taking at this time in my life, my dad died three years ago, my brother passed in October of 09 and my mom just moved in with me.  I found that my antidepression pills were helping but sometime I just felt like I was going to jump out of my skin and take someone with me.  This just took the edge off of everything and made things much easier to handle.	tired, sleepy, dry mouth, sometimes diarreha, not much of an appetite.	Taken for anxiety,initially in an acute stage. This was followed by a decision by patient (myself) to continue for 3 months in order to reduce arousal levels whilst undertaking therapy using the theraputic model ACT.
1625	premarin	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	memopause	"I believe that the Premearin allowed normal vaginal secretions and
somewhat emotional stability.  During the time I was using the Premarin I had
decreased hot flashes/sweats that, I presumed was a result of the drug, although the hot flashes are much more infrequent now that I'm using the natural progesterone cream."	While using the Premarin pills for Hormonal Replacement Therapy I was also taking Progestin so am unsure as to which drug was causing my very painfully tender breasts with increased fibrocystic breast disease noted on my annual momograms. I suspect that these drugs were also contributing to the blood sugar issues and low throid.	I chose to discontinue the HRT completely after I developed a painful mastitis in my lt breast, and 6months later a mamogram showed a suspicious spot that was removed and biopsied. It was benign. Since stopping the Premarin and switching to a natural progesterone cream that I use vaginally I no longer have painful fibrocystic breasts and the hypoglycemia and hypothyroid have been healed thru prayer.
3035	seroquel	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	anxiety	None.	Seroquel caused severe paranoia in larger doses, severe tiredness in lower (25 50 and 100mg)doses.  Paranoia was so severe, any simple noise caused erratic heart rate and rapid breathing. Drug also caused an inability to move, as if being restrained or weighed down in larger doses. After two years of not taking the drug, and only a week at the highest dosage, there are still problems with low lying feelings of paranoia. Ex; being afraid to go outside at night or be near a window at night or anywhere alone during the day when that was never a problem before the medication.	25mg once at bedtime to start first week, then 50, 75, 100, 150, then 200mg final dosage after weekly increase. Tiredness was suppose to subside in increased dosages, which really I feel it was so highly increased that it had a reverse affect and made it impossible to sleep or move or even hear a pin drop without thinking it was the front glass door being broken into.
2020	protonix	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	peptic ulcer	The benefits of taking Protonix 20 mg is that my ulcer cleared up, and I was able to resume eating what I call normal foods.  I changed and stopped eating pizza, meat balls or extremely spicy foods, but if possible I will take a Tums before just to reduce any chance of problems.	I don't believe I had any side effects.  I know Protonix just like Nexium can be an addictive medicine simply because it work so well.  Some people seem to have minor side effects, but I am in great health and in good shape and I did not seem to have any side effects from using Protonix.	Instructed by Ear-Nose - Throat Specialist to take pills with water 30 to 60 minutes - before Breakfast and then same time frame before Dinner. 40mg
791	ambien	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleeplessness	More often than not, I was able to sleep for 3-4 hours of uninterrupted sleep.	"Restless leg syndrome may be aggravated if Ambien and elevil are taken at the same time.  I stopped taking elevil for RLS on the nights I took ambien.  Sometimes the RLS was still aggravated even though I did not take elevil.
Short term memory loss.
Binge eating at night."	Ambien, the brand name product seemed to work better than the generics.  I only take the generic, zolpidem once in a while.  I have asked my doctor to prescribe Ambien CR to see if it will be more effective.
2663	prinivil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hbp	After starting on a diuretic and a beta blocker without significant results, adding the ACE inhibitor worked wonders, and has continued to do so for 27 years. The next step, if one becomes necessary will be to add a sartan. Based on my previous response. I expect it to be a happy experience.	For no apparent reason the dosage needs to be adjusted, up or down from time to time. Fortunately hypertension is not asymptomatic in this patient: have a headache, it's up, raise the dose; feel wiped out, it's down, lower the dose. All this has been confirmed by home, office, and pharmacy readings.	was taken for hypertension. no excessive side effects. medication was taken on a daily basis, once pill per day.

Mainly helped relieve brain fog that is common with Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia. Especially noticeable while working. Able to function better and work longer, more like my old self.	Weight loss, decreased appetite. If take too late in the day, may affect ability to sleep.	Take 1 pill in the morning to treat ADD-like symptoms that started after a car accident. Took several years to get Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia diagnosis and quite awhile after that before this medicine was prescribed. Tried most of the standard ADD medications to help with brain fog but bad side effects, worked for awhile then stopped, or no effect. Many doctors not comfortable perscribing this medication for ADD or ADD-like symptoms since it's a weight-loss medicine. I usually only take this medication during the work week and give my body a break on teh weekends.
570	atenolol	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	supra ventricular tachycardia	I frequently experience heart palpitations at random times for random durations of time. Atenolol has help to suppress these palpitations, so I don't experience them as often. It has drastically reduced the number of episodes I have and also lessens the pounding feeling when the episodes do occur.	I have experienced a few side effects, such as lowered blood pressure. This lead to frequently feeling tired and lethargic. I also get very cold very easily due to low blood pressure. I am also beginning to think that it is effecting my short term memory, but I'm not sure if that's just me. I'm also not anxious anymore. I never suffered from anxiety problems, but I have noticed that I really don't get nervous over anything really!	"""I have been taking the generic Tenormin (atenenol) for probably 32 years now.  25 mg.  I take it at night.  Never had a problem, EXCEPT when I could not see my doctor and had to see someone else in the practice.  He thought I should get off the drug; said there were new better things.  He took me off it and I was going on vacation the next day or so.  Worse vacation ever.  I thought I was dying.  My heart was pounding.  I thought I would die up in the mountains.  Got back on Atenol when I got back home.  Everything was normal.  If I accidently miss a day or so, I can tell the difference.  I don&#039;t know about all the side effects other people have had, but it works great for me."""

1179	prozac	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Within a few days, my mood, self-esteem, attitude and over-all well-being improved tremendously! I went from feeling suicidal and not being able to funtion properly in order to take care of myself or my family, to feeling better than I had since I was in my teens. I began to lose some of the weight I had gained from being depressed. I was in a wonderful mood and I had so much more energy than I had in years. My overall experience with Prozac has been perfect!	I have had no known side effects to this date. I do watch out for muscle cramps that last more than a week and I have blood work done once a year to ensure that my kidneys are not being affected.	I started on 10 mgs. once a day and when that was tolerated well I went up to 40 mgs. This caused some insomnia and nervousness so my Dr. lowered it to 20 mgs. a day. There are still times I get depressed for a few days but that only happens once or twice a year and it is mild. I am looking at being on Prozac as long as my body toleates it, due to once being taken off I went into a fast downward spiral and had to begin again.

Severe diarrhea, very severe vomiting	After suffering numerous bladder infections, it was determined that I needed longterm antibiotic treatment to get the problem under control. Six months of Keflex. Because this was 25 years ago I am not sure of the dosage.
1894	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe peridontal disease	I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish.	None.	A dentist in my dental HMO prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because I implored him to do so.

Dopey feeling, extreme fatique, procrastination, numb feeling.	"My MD perscribed the medication for some increasingly intense feelings of anxiety around presenting to certain groups of people in higher levels of management.  I was hoping for something that I could take only on a ""as needed"" basis as I've never been one to take medication unless absolutely needed.  My MD does not believe in prescribing that kind of medication due to the highly addictive nature. I do not like the side effects of this drug and do not intend to continue it."

I was able to sleep better and deal with anxiety and stress better.	dry mouth was the worst side effect but since I should drink more water anyway it was a mixed blessing.

2297	lexapro	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, lack of motivation	My obsessive thoughts completely disappeared. This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset.	I did not gain or loose weight. My sex drive became non-existent. I was no longer able to achieve orgasm. This really became an issue only when my dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg. Ultimately, I stopped the pill because of this. Now, I am starting again (only 10 mg/day) because I am so lethargic, depressed, and full of obsessive thoughts.	My dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg after about 2 months. I took the 20 mg dose for one month but then I abruptly stopped because of the side effects. I did not have any problem stopping the pill (no withdrawal symptoms at all). My sex drive and the ability to orgasm came back.
363	neurontin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	neck/shoulder spasms	Decreased number of spasms and pain associated with the spasms.	The only side effect i have experienced was apin over my entire body due to weaning off the medication. Nuerontin must be weaned off very carefully with the help of a PCP.	I first started on 100mg a day and the next day i could feel aldifference in my body. I had less fatigue and my spasms were not as extreme as they had been. My specialist increased my dose to 600mg 3x a day. I have been on the dose for 5 yrs and have had little to no neck and shoulder spasms.  I wish i had know about this treatment yrs ago.  I would have lived in a pain free environment and would have been much happier.

3722	lamictal	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	bi-polar	Patient reported fewer mood swings, with very few side effects. Less affective toward depression, but she was able to reduce the amount of lithium, which caused extensive side-effects. This medication was implemented as part of her regular treatment plan.	Dizziness, fatigue, nausea, which were negligable if taken before bed.	"I started treatment when I was in what seemed like a mixed state--barely able to leave my bed at times, having to go into the bathroom at work to cry nearly every day, having strong urges to self-mutilate, and having a lot of suicidal ideation. I was also very agitated and angry, lashing out at loved ones for seemingly no reason. Lamotrigine started lifting the depression almost immediately, and once I hit the theraputic dose of 200 mg, it was like a cloud lifted overnight. I still have some ups and downs, but nothing major, and even when destructive thoughts cross my mind, I'm able to push them away more easily.

I have recently had a rather intense relapse into bulimia, but I doubt that's related to the lamotrigine either way."

I was prescribed this drug for BV after getting an abnormal pap and Colposcopy done. All doctors and pharmacists are quick to tell you that you should not drink with it. That is very true, after taking this drug for 5 days and feeling awful from it, I decided to go ahead and drink a few beers. So nauseous! HEED THE DOCTORS WARNING ON THIS!!!! Finally threw up and took a nap and felt much better. I DID NOT know that the PG (in my vape juice) is why I felt so bad for the whole first 5 days. It actually was a Vape site that made it clear to me. I understand that all info can be found in a leaflet that you get when you pick up the med, I just didn&#039;t put it together about PG and it being in almost all my e-juice."""
2258	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression and anxiety	It took the edge off of my stress and anxiety level and helped me feel more present and even-keeled.  I started taking it during a difficult period and it helped lighten my mood.  I did not feel like I was numbed or that I was unable to feel highs and lows.	I gained a few pounds.  It may have had a slight effect on my sex drive, but that is hard to tell.	in combination with talk therapy, i took 40 mg of Lexapro in the morning because when I took it in the evening, it caused some restlessness.

It didn't make me jittery. It just boosted my energy. It did give me considerable dry mouth. I did notice that I would be a little more tired if I didn't take it for a couple of days. I think it is mildly addictive. Overall, I gained more benefit from it than negatives. I did worry about blood pressure because it did seem to increase my heartrate. I would recommend it to those who suffer from mild depression and/or just need a little extra energy boost. The medication is actually to treat narcolepsy, a condition in which a patient falls asleep at random times and has trouble staying awake.	Dry mouth, mild addictive properties, slight increase in heart rate.	My bipolar disorder is often at the lowest points more than the highest points anymore. In the past I switched moods much more rapidly and was given the diagnosis of Rapid cycling bipolar disorder. After my first daughter was born it only got worse. Weeks without any sleep! Then when my second daughter was born something changed within me. I couoldn't wake up at night to even hear her cry. My husband took vacation time to stay home to let me rest. I relapsed worse than ever with my eating disorder and required my 3rd feeding tube and I just could not function enough to even take care of myself, normal life or even my baby girls. I was go into fits of rage from the sheer exhaustion and would CLEAN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS without eating , drinking, sleeping or even sitting! Then I would crash! Finally my doctor decided to jusy try provigil, and it has helped a great deal along with cymbalta. I'm not sure why becasue according the everything I know about both medications...they are completely wrong for me. However, nothing else has worked thu far. I have taken EVERYTHING! This has been a dream for me even if I don't have as much pep in my step as I would like....I'm not a blank, lifeless, useless zombie.

1529	skelaxin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	neck & arm muscle spasms	The Skelaxin aided in my recovery from cervical disc surgery.  It eased muscle spasms and tightness in my neck, chest and arm.	The Skelaxin would (at times) make me sleepy.  And it would relax my stomach muscles, allowing stomach acid to creep up into my throat and cause a burning sensation. The AcipHex would keep the stomach acid under control.	As a result of my cervical disc (5-7) surgery, my neck, chest, left shoulder/arm/hand and face have a tendency to become inflamed if I lift something heavy, I am tired or I over use my arm.  Therefore, I continue to take the medications to ease my pain and numbness.  Additionally, I use Motrin IB, 200-800mg, as necessary.

Taken on an empty stomach, mild transient nausea, but this is quickly addressed with any light snack. Discontinuation syndrome (when I have run out of the medication, or once when discontinued for 2 days due to elective surgery) is quite unpleasant.	Prescribed to act synergistically with stimulants prescribed for ADHD: the stimulants tend to increase anxiety, which also increases the necessary therapeutic dose for the stimulants, so this very low dose of the multiple reuptake inhibitor effectively reduces the dosage needed of the stimulant for therapeutic effect. This combination enabled me to reduce my stimulant dosage by 50% and also decreased my anxiety very substantially--the effect was almost immediately remarked on by my partner as well as in my own subjective opinion.
2882	avita	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hyper pigmentation, wrinkles	After only three days of treatment my partner noticed a reduction in the hyperpigmentation, it took me about a month to notice these effects. Having used tretinoin now for two months the crepiness under my eyes is greatly reduced, there is undoubtedly a marked improvement in the texture of my skin and the hyperpigmentation is getting better every day.	Side effects were minor skin irritation especially in naso labial folds(itching, flaking and redness) and under eye area (slightly swollen on waking), however these symptoms were short lived and in the space of ten days disappeared altogether. There were a couple of occasions where i noticed small dry patches of skin which vanished in a couple of days.	very simple really,  wash and dry face at night, wait thirty minutes for face to dry completley, apply a pea sized amount of tretinoin avoiding corners of nose and eye lids.
2338	propecia	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	male pattern hair loss	The hair on the crown of the head significantly and visually filled in to the state it was 5 years earlier and has maintained this growth since.	It seems that it sometimes takes an extra moment or two to finish urinating to avoid dripping. Side effect is not noticable if the drug is taken before bed.	I take the drug once a day at night with a small glass of water.
718	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Clearing of acne.	Headaches, dry lips, dry skin, elevated triglycerides.	Had severe cystic acne.  Went to dermatologist and received prescription for Accutane.  Took 100 mg (?) once daily.  Had check ups once a month and blood drawn once a month to check for any possible adverse effects.  Did have raised triglycerides due to treatment.  Acne began clearing halfway through treatment.  Skin looked wonderful once treatment was completed!
3087	minocycline	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I think that the treatment might have improved my acne somewhat, but it always returned.  I stayed on this drug for several years, along with using topical medications.  I was using so many prescriptions that I don't really know which if any of them helped.  I always still had some acne during this treatment.	Chronic yeast infections leading to daily use of nystatin, yogurt, suppliments, etc.  Especially since treatment spanned high school and college years, the effect of having recurring yeast infections was particularly worrisome.  I also did not know when I was prescribed nystatin to deal with the yeast infections from minocycline that the nystatin could have negative long-term effects on my liver.	I felt the medicine only slightly cleared my acne.  I would say 30% clearer skin.; yet I did not want to stop taking it b/c I felt it would get worse.  I also took Predisone 5 days before my menstrual cycle, as I tended to break out more, but did not see a difference.

4039	tri-luma	3	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	melasma	"The first time I used the drug it lightened the patches of melasma. The second time I used it, about a year later, it actually darkened them. I was told that happens to some people who use hydroquinone and that I will never be able to use it. I use sun block every day, year round.

I am Irish-Italian-German-Dutch. My skin is fair yet any trauma results in hyperpigmentation."	See above	Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the Sun. Please be aware, read more information online.

I had tried eyelash extensions previously but they only worsened the problem by breaking off or pulling out what skimpy lashes I did have.  After several months of Latisse I have eyelashes and even though I apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too.	My eyelids became red and itchy for the first month of use.  It was bothersome but not enough that I quit using the product.  After about 4-6 weeks the redness went away and I have not been bothered by it again.	"""Lashes are much longer and fuller.

2849	albuterol	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	asthma	"Having had asthma since I was a child, I have been using various medications for a long time. Thankfully I do not need to use albuterol daily, as I know some people do, but I use it as needed when I am experiencing an asthma attach. This happens on average once a month, less in warmer months, more during the winder.

As far as being effective albuterol, and the name brand inhaler is the best, and to my knowledge, still the only small inhaler that really works. I'm sure it has saved lives. With one inhalation I am able to breath again within minutes, this is even if I am having a bad attack, and am really strugling. So it is very effective"	But, when I use albuterol I experience mild chest pains afterward. Not immediately, but typically later that day or the next. They don't last long, just a sharp pain or two, but it does occur fairly often. In my case, since I don't use albuterol regularly, it's well worth it.	Inhalation, pump spray

1864	augmentin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	subungal hematoma	The medicine was taken to prevent infection since a hole was drilled to drain the gathered blood and release pressure on my nail bed.  As a result, I am in the process of regrowing a healthy nail.	There were no adverse side effects.  By taking the medication and ensuring that the wound was kept clean, infection was kept at bay.	I was prescribed Augmentin at 875mg to be taken twice a day for 10 days in order to fend off infection in my nail bed.  Meanwhile,I used topical iodine and hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound several times a day and applied new bandages at each cleaning.  Once the swelling and pain subsided and growth of a new nail was evident, I trimmed away what I could of the damaged nail to allow the new one space to grow and to aid in keeping the wound clean.

149	zmax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	lingering infection - ear, sinus, throat	This treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  Although I didn't miss any dose times, if I had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage.	I've experienced no side effects with this medication as in opposition to some others which have given me problems, especially stomach discomfort/upset.  I do usually follow-up with yogurt or another form of pro-biotic after prescription antibiotics.	Take 2 tablets the first day by mouth; then, one tablet on days 2-5.  Don't take medicine within one hour before or two hours after aluminum or a magnesium-containing antacid.  Finish all of the medication, even if symptoms of the illness disappear prior to full prescription time demands in length.  Store medicine @ room temperature, away from heat and light.  Medicine may cause sensitivity to sun; avoid exposure to sun.  Notify physician if swelling, rash or hives, breathing difficulties become present.  Do not do anything that could be dangerous (Ex:  driving, operating machinery) until you know how this medicine will affect you.
382	corgard	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mytral valve prolapse	The medication works very well in conjunction with the Quinadine Gluconate to help calm the extra heart beats.  I started on the medication when I was 19 and am still on it today at age 50.  I've tried other new drugs but always seem to come back to this tried and true one.	The only complaint I have is that Corgard tends to lower your blood sugar if you are prone to that anyway.  If I increased my dosages to over 20mg daily, I would have many problems with low blood sugar, even to the point of passing out.  I learned how to deal with it, but wish it was not a side effect.	I was put on Corgard because of the Mytral Valve prolapse.  I am very symptomatic.  This greatly reduced the skipped beats. I take 1 tablet at night before going to bed.
2309	lexapro	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	My doctor prescribed Lexapro to treat my condition of Major Depression Disorder (MMD.)  In addtion to Major Depression Disorder, I also have Anxiety Disorder, and prior to treatment, I occassionally get into hyperventilation. I felt better after several days into taking Lexapro, and I was able to sleep better also.	I had nobody to take me to my doctors' offices, so I had to drive myself around. The sedation side effect was very strong on me, and I could not drive safely. My friends also made comments that my responsiveness had gone a lot worse at that time.  By the third week into taking Lexapro, I had to call my doctor and requested to have a different drug in replacement.	To treat the Major Depression Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, I visited my psychologies on a weekly basis, and my psychiatrist once every two or three weeks. The first drug that the psychiatrist recommended was Lexapro, and I started with the 5 mg dosage, after which I took the 10 mg for about three weeks. As mentioned above, I had to call my psychiatrist by the third week to request a different drug due to significant side effects.

Would only take a tablet when I was feeling particularly vulnerable for example at the funeral and times when feeling overcome. I think that this is the best thing about valium you only have to take it when you really need it and it works almost immediately and for me without undesirable side effects. You just have to be careful and not take constantly for long periods of time.I know of many people who have been prescribed the newer anti depressants and have gone through the most horrendous side effects, personally I wouldnt touch them.
3215	penlac	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	toe nail fungus	none-I'm still taking it until the bottle runs out (like 3 more months) but I'm not optimistic. My dermatologist said toe nail fungus is really hard to treat. I have it on my big toe and it's not pretty. I tried homemade remedies first-white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide and Vicks vapo rub (which didn't work either but I swear better than both of the medications) The I tried Naftin gel for 3 months and now the paint-on Penlac generic.	none-my frustration, lost money (the generic is $99/bottle)	Paint the nail lacquer onto the infected nail, one coat a day, At the end of the week, remove it with alcohol and start the process all over again. Unfortunately, it seems like my nail isn't growing, which is why I'm afraid if I remove the nail (with a podiatrist) that it may not grow back-my dermatologist agrees I should not have the nail removed; she wants me to live with it. She says that even with Lamasil and all that expense and liver damaging drug, the fungus can still come back in 2 months.

Has made me gain weight and became more easily fatigued (all SSRI can disrupt REM sleep phases, resulting in less satisfying rest). During the last few years, when I have been stable and very happy, I have tried several times to cease the medication, including under the support of a naturopath. This medication is very hard to get off without significant side effects (including vertigo and nausea), however, as my medicxal professional has stated, some people just need to stay on them for a longer time.	I have been on 20mg (one tablet) of Paroxetine for around 5 years now, as well as see a psychologist for 6 months.
12	nasonex	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	allergies	Using Nasonex improved my sneezing, runny nose and stuffiness from year round allergies.  I no longer had to carry tissues with me everywhere I went.  My sleep improved and I was more alert at work.	I did suffer from more sore throats, headaches and nose bleeds while I was using the medication.  These were not too severe.  I stopped using it when it stopped working as well and began using Singular.	I used Nasonex for 3 years to treat my year round allergies.  It was very effective but did have side effects. After 3 years, it stopped being effective.

Not willing to avoid spicey foods my physician prescribed ranitidine. I recall he intially prescribed 150mg twice daily. At one point he recommended 300mg twice aday. But 150mg twice daily is working. The dosage reduced the occurence of heartburn (my symptoms)to near zero."	I am not aware of any side effects. However that does not mean I have not experienced any. I think headaches are a side effect and I get them occasionally, but I cannot tie it to the medication. In any case I do not experience any kind of debilitating medical problems or even annoying ones that I can link to taking ranitidine.	"""It really worked very well. I had silent reflux disease, I feel better now. I took Ranitidine 150 mg every night, NOT twice a day as prescribed. One tablet before bedtime has done wonders."""

Right away I noticed a difference in my behavior. It took awhile for them to even out, so I didn't rely on my next dose.
3536	lunesta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Sleeping was possible.  It works well without making me sleepy the next day like Ambien did.  It also works quickly as long as you lie down right away.	Bad taste in mouth in the morning was bothersome in the beginning but it goes away over time the longer you take the drug.  However, lineage did not work well at all if I ate anything near bed.  The directions say it does not work well with fatty foods.  But, it also did not work if I even took a fish oil supplement, which is a fatty acid.  Even the smallest amount of fat, like a pat of butter on a piece of toast renders it ineffective.  When that happens, I would cut another pill in half and would be able to sleep.  This is a time release drug and should not actually be cut in half!	Taken as needed for insomnia.

I have had zero side effects. I am prone to anxiety like I&#039;m assuming a lot of other people here. The first day or two I took it, I attributed a faster heartbeat and feeling blue to the Nasacort. It&#039;s false correlation due to panic.

510	amerge	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Amerge is effective in reducing the pain and associated symptoms of migraines.	Mild drowsiness, sometimes mild nausea.	I have very severe migraine disease and have tried many different treatments.  None are effective 100% of the time.  In my experience, Amerge is the most effective for mild and moderate migraines (Nothing seems to work for severe attacks). I prefer Amerge because the beneficial effects seem to last longer than many of the other anti-migraine meds (often 18-24 hrs.). Also, side effects seem to be negligible(No palpitations and dizziness like with imitrex). The downside is that Amerge takes longer to work (2-4 hrs) than the other triptans. But because of the better safety profile and the longer duration of effectiveness, for me Amerge is a top choice for migraines.

My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication."	None.	I take two 8mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve. I do this again at night as I get into bed. That's pretty much it!

3784	keflex	2	Ineffective	No Side Effects		None.  I had a bacterial infection accompanying my flu and there wasnt a single noticeable benefit.	The only good point I suppose is that there was no adverse reaction, such as yeast infection or stomach upset. The downside was the bacterial infection quickly got worse.	Absoutely innefective.  I easily could have been takign a sugar pill for those results.  Bacterial infection became coniderably worse and was later put on another antibiotic to relieve symptoms.
3523	lunesta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	I have trouble sleeping -- I usually toss and turn all night, sleep a couple of hours and wake up.  Normally, I never get a complete night's rest.  After my doctor prescribed Lunesta, it was the first time in a very long time, that I was able to sleep from the time I laid my head on the pillow until my alarm sounded in the morning.	"I had no side effects from using Lunesta.  I felt refreshed in the morning without that groggy feeling or ""hang over"" like feeling."	The treatment involved taking one pill in the evening right before bed.  Lunesta works relatively fast, so you do not want to take it unless you are going right to bed because you become drowsy within 10 minutes.
261	ultram	1	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	headaches	My pain would subside for several hours. The drug gave me a sense of Euphora which allowed me to deal with the pain better. It gave me a comforting sensation and allowed me to sleep good. My mood changed for the better, almost as if I were high.It actually motivated me to do the things i would normally be too lazy to do. This medication put me in a good mood and a carefree mood.	I would have mild itching	I began taking this medication as prescribed but it put me in such a good mood I began taking more...and needing more. It works great for anxiety also but when I stopped taking it I had the most horrible withdrawls. I could not sleep. My insides felt like they were jumping. I was awfully tired and depressed. I could not keep my arms and legs still when i sat down. It was horrible. I WAS ADDICTED TO THIS MEDICATION AND I STILL AM.  I am still trying to wean off of it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MEDICINE TO ANYONE. Especially if you've had an addiction problem with any other pain meds. BEWARE!!!!!!!!

Sharon complained of severe chest pain from the pills around 8:30 at night.  She was also on a lot of other medications and I think the combination of medicines put her into heart attack and she passed away.	She took one pill at the Doctors office and she took one home to take.  She died some time that night.  I think it was too much medication and combination of different medicines.  I miss her so much.

2687	prinivil	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hypertension	My mother had slight high blood pressure and was prescribed Lisinopril along with the water pill. The medication was doing its job, lowering BP to normal.	Patient started with a sporadic cough. Any fragrance at all no matter how light the fragrance was would trigger a cough attack. Patient thought it was allergies. It then worsened and she was coughing day and night. She couldn't even sleep. It became so severe she was coughing all the time, when she talked when she ate. It was exhausting and debilitating, the cough was killing her. She then thought it was some lung problem, although she is not a smoker.  She went to the Dr and Dr did a few allergy test and lung x rays.  Well, then finally Dr checked high blood pressure medication.  Yes, of course!!! it was the medication.  She stopped taking it and the cough was completely gone, just like magic.	Patient was taking a low dose of Lisinopril 1 pill a day for slight high blood pressure. She took the medication on and off for 5 years.  She would take it when she felt she needed it.  Sometimes for about 3 months in a row and other times just 1 time a week.  Sometimes she would stop taking it for a couple of months.
3327	tetracycline	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rosacea	Pustules disappeared and the redness diminished		I took the antibiotic twice daily on an empty stomach to treat grade 5 rosacea.  Although I still get the odd pustule one week prior to menstruation, I do at least generally now have a clear complexion.  My face is still rather rosie - most people think I look healthy!  Sleep, or rather lack of it, seems to affect the condition too.  Before taking the tablets I had at least half a dozen spots on each cheek all of the tim.
2951	zyban	2	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	to quit smoking	After taking the Zyban for 3 weeks my desire to smoke was nearly eliminated. I had tried other methods to quit smoking and this one actually worked! Unfortunately I had a severe allergic reactions to the medication (the main ingredient Wellbutrin).	I initially broke out in hives which became so severe I was taken off the Zyban and prescribed a steroid. The allergic reaction internalized and I ended up missing 3 weeks of work do the joint immobility it caused.	I was impressed with the ability the medication had with my decreased desire to want to smoke, but the side affects/allergic reaction was to severe to continue using it.
1685	claritin	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	indoor allergies	"I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.

I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing, why not try it?  Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds."	It ended my year long depression.	Please see above.

I took one pill a day for 28 days, starting on the first day of the period. I tried to take the pill at approximately the same time each day, to improve the effectiveness of the medication.

3842	voltaren	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	primary dysmenorrhea	Hardly any- it was much less effective than paracetamol against the pain. I still had to take the maximum dose of ibuprofen to reduce the pain. I hoped taking Voltaren as well would extend the analgesic effects of the ibuprofen but it was fairly ineffective.		75 mg Voltaren & 2.4g ibuprofen a day during periods of extreme pain

I no longer stay awake for days on end and I never have to come home on my lunch break to nap.

Things were great for the time that I was on the medication but about 1 month after finishing it my skin returned to its old self - moderate/severe acne and extremely oily.  I took the second course of this medicine about 1 year later.  The second time was the same dose and time - 30mg per day for 3 months.  It had absolutely no effect on my acne or oily skin the second time around.  I am still battling this problem 10 years later.

Decrease on crisis of depression (specially during the days previous to my periods). More ""energy"" during the day to the daily things.. decrease on obsessive compulsive (mild) disorder"	The side effects with the intake of Fluoxetine for me included mild insomnia, headaches (specially in the beginning of the treatment). Loss of appetite. Mild change in the sense of taste. Little bit of nausea after a big meal. Or something very different from the usual food. Change in mood (varieting a lot specially in the beginning of treatment).	Fluoxetine 20mg. Taken once daily (variation: twice daily during week previous to period).

127	valtrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	facial herpes simplex	By taking the pills anytime I feel the vaguest possibility that I might be getting a cold sore, I was able to reduce the number of outbreaks. The outbreaks that I do have (if, for example, I don't take the Valtrex in time) seem not as bad as they would be without the Valtrex. The outbreaks seem somehow less... viral. As in, the sores may still form, but the entire process of blistering/opening/scabbing doesn't feel quite as much like my face is a nuclear radiation site.		I get horrible outbreaks in the center of my chin-- usually 5-8 sores clustered together all at once; really awful-looking. I'm aware of the things that trigger them, so when I realize there's a chance I might have an outbreak, even if I haven't felt the tingling yet, I'll take a couple of Valtrex and then I don't have an outbreak at all. I can't say for sure that it's the Valtrex stopping it (i.e. maybe I wouldn't have had an outbreak anyway in some cases) but it seems that way to me, and in any case it's nice to have some sense of control over the situation. Even though my outbreaks are awful, they only happen about 2x/year so I haven't felt it necessary to take the daily preventative pills.

live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil
and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management
physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When
I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from

The alendronate did not seem to stop the slow progression of my osteopenia, as measured by yearly bone density scans. I tried a regular exercise program, using a vibration machine (powerplate) and that stopped the progression of my osteopenia. I stopped the alendronate medication, thinking the exercise was more helpful and I was afraid of side effects.  However, the exercise alone did not work. I have re-started the alendronate medication and am hoping that the combination of the medication and exercise will help.	I have a bad taste in my mouth the day I take the alendronate medication and worry about side-affects, including long-term side affects which are undetectable currently.	I take the medication 1/wk.

It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.	The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal.	After being miserable with frequent (20+ times/day, 7-10 times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, I went on hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect, I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month. This is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but I feel much better overall because my IBS symptoms are much less severe and less frequent.

After washing my face with a gentle cleanser, I would wait 20 minutes and then put on the cream. I would then wait another 20 minutes and put some lotion on because the tretnoin was just too drying.

3607	retin-a	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	aging	I felt the cream was helpful.  Once the intitial effects were seen, they seemed to level out.  I used the cream nightly as I did not wear it during the day.  My skin felt smooth and soft after the first week.	Some redness did occur at first.  After the the first week, the redness disappeared.

The next day I was still shaky and dizzy, but not as bad as the day before. I remained nauseous, shaky, and dizzy for the remainder of the treatment.

I have found that when I stop taking it, I'll be fine for a few days or weeks, and then I start feeling symptoms of depression again. For the last 3 years, I have taken it regularly and am not planning on stopping. It doesn't make me feel happy every day, because that's not its purpose, however it does keep me from entering a depressive state."	I have not felt any side effects. I know other people feel loss of libido, but I did not suffer this pre-menopause. I have lost some libido since menopause, which is what I attribute it to.	I take 20 mg every morning with my vitamins. For 2 years I took 40 mg every other day, however I haven't felt the need to do this anymore.
2230	allegra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	The treatment benefits included but were not limited to anti histamine blocker, decongestant, etc. I was sneezing, coughing, had laringitis, allergy shiners, and could not sleep.

486	meridia	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	overeating, weight gain	I lost 90 pounds in 6 months. The key was drinking water all throughout the day. I ate 1 meal a day before 6pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce, fruit cups, canned fruit,etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food, icecream, chips or any other food that is unhealthy). I saw no results in the first month, but once 30 days had passed, I started to lose 1 lb. a day & sometimes 1 1'2 lb. a day. Even after getting off of Meridia, I still continued to lose weight 2 months later. Product was VERY expensive but worth it! The more weight you have to lose the more you WILL lose!	Insomnia sometimes. My bedtime(before Meridia) was around 10pm but once I began taking the medicine, I couldn't sleep sometimes until 12am or 1am, but even with lack of sleep, I never felt fatigued like I thought I would. Every once in a while, mild headaches & dry mouth. But nothing too major or life-threatening.	Lost 91 lbs. in 6-7 months. Kept the weight off even to this day (4 years later) b/c the Meridia taught me the key to weight loss: Less calorie intake. And since the Meridia trained my body to get full quicker, I was able to still eat & crave less even after getting off of the medication.

43	zyprexa	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder type ii	While taking Zyprexa, I never experienced any episodes of hypomania (low mania) which typically accompany Bipolar Type II; however, I attribute this mostly to the fact that Zyprexa is very sedating. It should be noted that although Zyprexa is classified as an A-typical antipsychotic, it is also used as a mood stabilizer in patients with Bipolar Disorder.	"Increased appetite which of course lead to weight gain which caused me to feel depressed!  I am not exaggerating when I say my appetite was almost insatiable. Excessive sleepiness during the day which caused me to actually start falling asleep while talking to someone on several occassions.  It also made me feel almost ""numb"" emotionally.  Sedation along with an insatiable appetite caused me to gain over 25 pounds."	My psychiatrist prescribed Zyprexa to help with the mood swings of Bipolar Disorder.  I am classified as Bipolar Type II because I do not experience the extreme highs of mania (manic episodes) that accompany Bipolar Type I.  I do, however, experience hypomania (hypo meaning low) so my moods still swing from highs to the extreme lows of depression.
2919	tramadol	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	osteochondral injury of the talus, left ankle	I had no benefits from this medication, if anything it added more problems for me. It never once relieved my pain in my ankle. Darvacet helped my ankle more then this medication. Even though I was switching because Darvacet was losing its effectiveness it would have been tons better to stay on Darvacet for all the bad Tramadol did for me.	My whole body ached I had severe stomachaches and headaches. I turned into a zombie all I did was stare at the wall. It would make me dizzy and at times I wouldn't know where I was at. I was scared to be on it, but I wasn't in my right mind to be able to take myself off of it. I took a blade one night and slashed both my arms up and hid the fact that I did it. I started to take myself off the medication. When I was able to think straight I admitted to people I know what I had done to my arms. Other then my ankle pain I felt 100% better off of Tramadol. I believe that if I were to stay on Tramadol I would have done something much worse. Since being off of this medication I realize how that person then wasn't me. That scared me more then anything ever. Doctor's need to monitor patients much more closely on Tramadol. I can't imagine that there are a lot of people with my reaction to it but I can't imagine even one other person having an adverse reaction like I did.	Took Tramal for the first two weeks then switched to Tramada since the pharmacy didn't have anymore Tramal available.. Due to the apparition of rash the treatment was stopped on the suggestion of a skin doctor.

4078	mobic	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	Pain reduction, increased mobility and range of motion.  The difference between how I feel with and without Mobic is astonishing.  Unfortunately, if I take this drug for more than six months straight, it begins to lose effectiveness.  Thus, I now save it for situations where I absolutely need it:  travel, sports, etc.	None.  My only complaint is that it loses effectiveness when taken over a period of time.	noneafter leg brace removed, i simply needed to walk. leg muscles neded to be forced to bend-at the same time the knee was cut to the bone in fall and i couldn't bend. the first 2 weeks i could not walk without crutch and put strain on my other leg & hip causing more pain. my skin seemed to be stuck to the bone and had to be manipulated by hand to break loose-this took several weeks w/ physical therapist and myself doing this.
1845	yasmin	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	birth control	By taking Yasmin I did not get pregnant, as it did act as a proper birth control method.

The doctors told me to come off them straight away. I contacted the makers and they too advised me to stay off them. If not for Swollen and sore breasts, I would have continued the use. My breasts returned to normal size, no pain."	If you have gynacomastia, be very careful....Thankyou. Lee.
1142	aromasin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	eostrogen-positive breast cancer	During the 4 years so far [out of 5], I have had no recurrance of the tumour and no additional tumours have been detected by ultra-sound, mammogram, and twice-yearly check-ups. Perhaps the greatest benefit is the gradual reduction in stress experienced as a result of my on-going stabilised condition after a lumpectomy.	I had some initial swelling of my hip, knee and ankle joints in the morning which slowly subsided during the day. The medication also aggravated the hot-flushes of the menopause, making them initially frequent and copious, and on-going for the treatment duration so far - tho with reduced frequency now in Year 4. I also experience considerable thirst.	"""Aromasin is a walk in the park after using the other aromatase inhibitors."""

I took Voltaren orally as instructed on the packet and it worked within a very short time and after one week the pain is very slight just a twinge now & then in my groin which reminds me that I need to rest!

Using Flonase stopped all allergy symptoms within just a few days.	When you spray it in your nostrils your mouth will have a horrid taste, but does not last long.	Once a day nasal spray, spray once in each nostril. It is very easy to use and works vey well.
2650	diclofenac	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	back pain slipped disk	"The Ibuprofen gel would enable instant relief as it could be applied topically and carried around easily in ones pocket/bag.
The Diclomax SR tablets tended to work quite quickly therefore providing quick relief. I also used an ice pack which combined with the other treatments mentioned gave me round the clock relief."	I experienced stomach pains and bleeding when tablets were taken on an empty stomach.  This was the only side effect I experienced and as long as you can be organised about when you eat and take the tablets then it causes no problems at all.  Given the fact I relied on these tablets for 3 years, the side effects were extremely mild and forgettable.	"""Lesion on elbow, area of rough scaly skin, itchy. Doctor didn&#039;t know what it was, but had lesion surgically removed. It returned even bigger, about 20mm diameter. Saw specialist who did biopsy. Non malignant. Treated with Solaraze. Lesion changed to open sore. Stopped treatment until sore healed. Used Paw paw ointment to soften it. That worked. Resumed Solaraze. Other smaller lesions have appeared close by. Will see specialist soon for assessment."""
1033	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult adhd	After taking Adderall XR for about a year, my doctor switched me to Vyvanse.  Vyvanse not only helps me focus and take away the symptoms of ADHD that I was experiencing, but it does so for about 12 hours.  With Adderall XR, the effects lasted only a few hours, and I experienced a crash after the effects wore off and I instantly because extremely cranky and irratable.  With Adderall XR, I also lost the desire to eat.  I am hungry with Vyvanse, and do have the desire to eat.  With Vyvanse, I do not feel the crash at the end of the day, and I do not experience any moodiness.  I am very please with this drug, and it has changed my life for the better.  I have reccommended it to other family members with the same problems that I have and they have shared with me similar success stories.	The only side effect I experience is times of having a slightly dry mouth.  The dry mouth I experienced with Adderall was much worse.	I had began taking 20mg of Vyvanse for three months and was surprised to find that such a small dose affected my mood so effectively.  When it came to school work though I found that I needed the 30mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  I had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the 20mg.  I find that the greatest benefit of Vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before I was perscribed.
2326	lexapro	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	I had hit the wall dealing with work, cllients,and family. My general physician asked me to see a therapist to help get me going in the right direction. After one meeting it was recommended by both caregivers that I take something to help me get through this rough spot. After about 3 weeks I started feeling like things were easier to cope with and I was making good decisions and getting things done again.	The only side effect I believe is some weight gain, approximately 10 pounds!!!!!	10 mg of Lexapro was prescribed to be taken 1x daily. I was advised that this drug builds up in the system over time and that results generally wouldn't be measurable until taken consistently for a minimum of 4-6 weeks.
3493	serzone	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	generalized anxiety disorder	Had generalized anxiety daily prior to treatment, and panic attacks that impaired ability to function normally and quality of life in general.

Noticed when skipping a dosage for 2-3 days, heightened anxiety returned.	Took 200 to 400 mg. of medication for 6 years for the treatment of anxiety.

I have had no vaginal dryness,my sex drive is still the same (high), no cramping, matter of fact, I was cramping very badly the day that I started the ring and within an hour of insertion, my cramps went away.  I actually had blood clots before I started the ring, and now my periods are so much more lighter so I am not clotting at all. :)  Also, my period duration has been cut in half from 5-7 days to 3 or 3.5 days.  I think it's AWESOME!!  My partner does not feel it at all and we have it enthusiastically (vigorously)!	I had a very bad headache for about a week, but it's ok now.  I had a sinus infection last week, and I thought it was from it being springtime, but then I read that sinus infections could be a side effect.  I felt pretty awful last week and wanted to sleep a lot.  I am still not sure if it was just allergies or not.	I feel sorry for the women who have had negative side effects with the Nuvaring.  So far so good, so I am sticking to it!!

2948	zyban	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	The drug did exactly what it was supposed to do.  It completely eliminated all nicotine cravings leaving only the psychological aspect to worry about.  So if I kept myself busy, the thought of smoking would never even enter my mind.	For the first week or so, I was slightly hyperactive and had some trouble sleeping.  That problem went away with some adjustment in the time I took the drug as well as with my bodies assimilation of the drug.  I also had a mildly bad taste in my mouth.  That too faded away.	"""Started smoking at 13, up to 2 1/2 pack a day. Wife also smoked, up to 2 packs a day.  We both started Zyban at the same time.  Took meds and smoked for a week, stopped the smoking, then a week later, stopped the meds.  Haven&#039;t regretted doing it.  Although I don&#039;t feel a whole lot better, still huff and puff at the top of the stairs, gained about 25 pounds, but I know we are both better for having quit.

This drug allows you to take a pill in the early morning hours, go back to sleep and then get up at the normal time without any sort of hangover. It is wonderful.	Better sleep.	Upon waking and not being able to return to sleep, one 10 mg dose of Sonata will return the patient to sleep. If used too frequently, I understand that the product will be ineffective.
2795	wellbutrin	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	stop smoking	"The treatment was effective in reducing my ""appetite"" for smoking.  It also reduced my appetite for everything, including food.  Therefore, at first, I did manage to stop smoking WITHOUT gaining weight or being depressed about giving up the cigerates.  It just didn't seem important."	"After a while, I began to notice that NOTHING seemed important to me.  I also seemed to be moving in a world that had slowed down considerably.  That may sound good, at first, but the reality was that the only thing that had slowed down was ME--the rest of the world kept going as usual.  I began to notice that I couldn't seem to develop a sense of urgency even when it was IMPORTANT to do so because I had lost my sense of ""timing.""  I tended to be late everywhere I went, I couldn't complete assignments on time, and my sleeping time increased dramatically."	I was taking the Bupropion as an aide to break my smoking habit.  I was also using prescription nicotene patches in decreasing amounts.  The treatment WAS effective in TEMPORARILY breaking the smoking habit and possibly could have had longer lasting effects, however, my skin had a reaction to the patches (I started developing large, red, hot circles everywhere they touched my skin) and I found that I could not effectively lead my day-to-day life while under the influence of the Bupropion. Once I stopped using both products, I slowly returned to smoking.
47	clarinex	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Did stop the sniffles and clear the nasal passages.  Headaches were still a problem.  However, coupling this product with aspirin provided a good solution.	Did cause some drowsiness.  Alcohol did intensify this experience.  No reported upset stomach, as is the case with some of these products.	Treatment regimen was 1 5mg pill per day.  Did not need to take with food.
3519	lunesta	5	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	Help me sleep 6 hours	I drive for a living and I have more difficulty concentrating on my driving. I was more forgetful. I decided to discontinue lunesta because of the amnesia like side effects that interferes with my driving job. Good quality sleep should not make me feel like this. I use 25mg trazodone instead because it's safer for next day driving.	My care provider said to use lunesta three times week at bedtime. I only used it once because of the side effect described above. Also I was only able to get 6 hours of sleep instead of the eight that lunesta promoted in their advertisement.
3462	ambien-cr	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	I was able to turn my thoughts off at night	memory loose, I am dependent on the drug and look forward to when I can take it.  I not only experience memory loose @ the time of the dose but have also noticed were I cannot recall a week of activities.	a 12.5 mg pill a night
868	paxil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Definitely lowered anxiety.	"Didn't care as much as I needed to about deadlines and other stressful things. It was good that I wasn't overly anxious, but I also was less likely to work overtime to get things done.
What made me stop taking it was the increased jaw clenching that never went away."	"I took this medication during a protracted court drama that kept me on the edge of ""losing it""."
1764	topamax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	epilepsy	I started Topamax right after approval due to ongoing generalized (Grand mal) seizures that were resistant to other drugs. My epileptologist was hoping this would be the one. We added it on to what I was currently taking at the time (tegratol and dilantin) and crossed our fingers. Guess what? After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK, to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately, I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome.	"In the beginning I remember getting ""topatingles"" or tingling in my fingers (that hurt sometimes), toes, and even my lips. I lost a lot of weight and have stayed in the underweight category ever since. My memory vanished (I affectionately nicknamed this drug ""stupimax"" and ""Dopamax""), I got strange aches and pains in my bones, joints, and muscles. I was more sensitive to the sun and heat and my sweat was reduced. I frequently had a runny nose and cough. Food tasted funny. Sex felt different (not bad- just different) my skin was  very sensitive to touch and my hearing was overactive. My potassium kept testing deficient and I had to be prescribed supplements. My hair also fell out in clumps!

All that went away or got better with some time. I also found out WHY it was happening- I was malnourished. Once I started drinking 56-80oz of water a day, taking a multivitamin + biotin (for the hair issue!), eating potassium rich foods and a more healthy diet all of a sudden the side effects started to vanish. 

I still have dilantin side effects which are easy to distinguish as I've been on that since 1985, but the topamax ones are gone barring once and awhile I have a bit of 'loss of words' while speaking. I love this drug."	I take one 200mg tab in the morning and one 200mg tab in the evening. I take the brand name topamax as the generic one caused my blood levels to dive a bit and I had a breakthrough seizure. Too bad as the generic is much cheaper.
3073	emsam	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major chronic depressive disorder	I had become so severly depressed that I was incapable of holding a job.  My doctor had tried virtually all classifications of meds on the market but none were able to pull me out of the state I was in.  My world had become so dark I felt the sun would never shine again.  This med allowed me to function again within my family and within the working world.  I stopped crying all the time and was able to concentrate and perform the tasks necessary for employment.  I got my life back.	Unlike other antidepressants with numerous side effects, this med had no internal side effects.  The only complaint I had with this med was the skin irritation at the application site.  This I treated with moisturizers and hydrocortisone creams.	"I simply applied one patch daily to any part of the ""trunk"" area of my body.  It was not a drug I had to be introduced to slowly or weaned off of.  I found that the lowest dose available was effective for me.  Each day before my shower the previous days patch was removed so the site area could be cleansed.  After my shower the new patch was applied in a different location."
1796	citalopram	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, panic attack	I suffered from anxiety for years. My GP prescribed me the Citalopram after I got unfairly dismissed from my job. I didn't feel any difference for 2-3 weeks, then I felt great. I have been enjoying every second of my life since taking this drug.	I would say that the only side effect I found uncomfortable was that the drug made going to the toilet all the time. It gave me diarrhoea sometimes. I think that's to do with the additives	I have been taking 10mg of Citalopram twice a day after food.
3868	levoxyl	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroid	Initially I had Graves, then became hypothryoid post-treatment.  While hypothyroid I gained weight, had hair loss, was fatigued, cold and miserable.  Getting on a correct dose of thyroid replacement is great.  My hair returned, I became more fit and active.	When on too much levothyroxine I was jittery, had weight loss and was emotional.  If I had too little I had difficulty with bloating and fatigue.  It was certainly a drug that had to be monitored and adjusted based on lab levels and side effects.	Take one pill first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and wait at least an hour to eat.
1117	effexor	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"the treatment reduced the following symptoms of depression: apathy, lack of
interest in daily activities, passive suicidal ideation, loss of energy."	"the treatment resulted in augmentation of restless legs and induced weekly migraines. this required three additional medication to manage the side effects.
these medications also had side effects."	"the treatment was started two years ago and was intially very effective.
despite causing augmentation of restless legs and inducing weekly migraines
a decision was to stay on the medication and treat the side effects. over
time the antidepressant effects waned but the side effects continued so I
am slowly being withdrawn from the effexor. the seroquel has had side effects
as well."
2938	prednisolone	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	lupus-like systemic autoimmune condition	keeps me alive during flare-ups!  (They incl pericarditis & pleural effusions, ie inflammation of the lining around the heart and lungs � involving LOTS of fluid for which there isn't space, leading to heart failure and breathlessness - nice...) I can more or less live a normal life, apart from at the start of a flare (and spending hours researching online!).	rampant hunger at high dose (above 25mg) - but, with discipline (and vanity!) have managed to keep my weight within 4lbs of my prior weight; SLIGHT rounding of face (I'm lucky!); bodily skin thinning, particularly evident on my shins (I use Nivea CoQ10 firming lotion - fab � all over, 2x daily, and am about to start taking Qsilica to see if it'll help); most importantly...slight bone density loss when tested 20 mths ago (next DEXA scan is later this month) but as well as exercising, I take daily organic calcium, magnesium, L-Lysine (amino acid), boron, zinc, 2 gms slow release vit C, marine collagen, plus am trying to eat an alkaline diet to keep body at neutral pH (see SaveOurBones online - I have no affiliation!).	For good reasons (not typical lupus, plus 'you know your body best'), my Doc and Consultant basically leave me to decide my dosage! After 3 years I have learnt that when I have the 1st definite signs of a flare-up (pericarditis symptom, ie pressure in neck when bending over), I need to put the dose up to 30mg straight away - from trial and error, anything less just doesn't work, ie putting dose up to e.g. 15mg, then 20mg, then 25mg gives the flare-up more time to really get hold of me! Am trying to decide whether to take 'steroid-sparing' drug Azathioprine as well...v hard decision as it's a serious immune suppressant and has scary side-effects. Hey ho! (Once tried 35mg for a couple of days when 30mg wasn't quite sorting it, and got tingly lips - checked online and thought it could be a sign of calcium deficiency; called Doc, he agreed (!) so went back down to 30mg and was fine.)
3470	ambien-cr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia, chronic pain	Able to sleep and turn my brain off.  Helped chronic pain without using pain medication.  Slept through the night.  Was not sleepy like I was before I took it.	some amnesia.  Need to go to sleep immediately.	I take it once in 3 days.  I would love to take it every day.  I sometimes take Rozerem the other 2 days but it isn't near as effective.
1827	yasmin	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	easy prevention of pregnancy.	Not many - some mild bloating about a week before period, some moodiness.  I don't think this prescription is the best for any type of PMS symptoms, but since I don't really suffer from this, it was not a problem for me.	One pill taken at around the same time daily.  The packaging is easy to follow - it has different stickers so that you can start the pcak on any day, not just Sunday.  This pill is pretty expensive, around $$50 per month.  I think some of the generics are much cheaper.
307	protopic	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	white spots on facial skin	White spots which appeared and were growing in size (and assumed to be infammatory) are gone	None.	Small amount of the ointment was applied twice per day for three weeks and the spots gradually reduced in size and dissapeared.  Because this is a very strong medication it was applied somewhat sparingly to be conservative and it still worked.
2306	lexapro	6	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.	On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.	The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.
29	alprazolam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic disorder, agoraphobia	Helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months, quickly reduced my anxiety and I didn't have any attacks.	Barely any despite some slight confusion.	"""When I start to pace around the room, swimming in my non-stop traffic of thoughts I know I need to take my Xanax, it calms me and I even stopped smoking out of anxiety."""
450	lorazepam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia, anxiety	"I go to sleep within an hour and a half of taking it. I even get up to use the toilet around 4 am and I have no problem falling back asleep. Tried Ambien for 6 months, but I had to keep upping the dose and I still couldn't sleep. Plus Ambien made my anxiety worse. Now my anxiety is gone and I am generally more content with life. ""I can sweat the small stuff"", if you know what I mean. I did start Prozac about the same time."	"I haven't had any at all, even if I miss a night which is rare. My mornings are slow, but than again I've never been a ""morning person"". One cup of tea and I'm good to go."	"""Wonderful takes stress away"""
1644	sumatriptan	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	The drug rapidly gets rid of migraine.	The drug causes slight dizziness and tightness around my temples.  Sometimes I also feel slightly nauseated after taking it, but perhaps I should blame the headache and not the medication.	"""I&#039;ve been a migraine sufferer since I was 10 years old. My Dr prescribed sumatriptan 2 years ago and honestly now I can&#039;t live without it I take one tablet and within 20 mins the migraine is completely gone. Side effects for me are hot flushes for a few hrs and I have really achy heavy joints the next day anybody else get these side effects?"""
2989	strattera	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	The medication helped me with concentrating and it helped calm me down when i was feeling anxious.	THe only side effects I experienced with the medication was usually within an hour of taking it i would get extremely drowsy.  I would sleep for about 30 minutes then wake up.	"Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me), then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication. Seems to retain efficacy, COMPLETELY eliminate stomach problems and GREATLY reduce grogginess -though that also seems to be partly dependent on how much sleep I get (minimum of 6 hours, preferably 8 or 9). Now that I discovered this trick, I am feeling MUCH better and no longer considering abandoning the medication! I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus, remember, and feel more aware of surroundings. Would cry now if I had to go back to not using it - I almost can't function without medication, and the non-stimulant allows me to sleep SO much better and I do not ""crash"" from it!"
1699	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	"I started using Retin-A after the birth of my second child when I broke out with
adult acne.  At the time it was not advertised as an anti aging cream and as I was only 26 or so I really wasn't concerned about wrinkles. Because of the warning of photosensitivity increase to sun exposure I used sunscreen daily (I lived in Tampa,FL). Now at the age of 62 I have gorgeous skin. Yes, I LOVE products but my basic regimen has not changed. Cleansing,Sunscreen and Retinol-A
at bedtime. I had been on HRT for 10 years  so that should be factored in to the equation."	The humidity in Florida helped so much in building up tolerance for the drying effect of Retin-A. I had to be extremely careful NOT to introduce any other strong product AHA or Gylgolic Acid and washing once daily with mild cleanser (Cetaphil). Once Retin-A Micro was introduced to the public I switched and I literally can smear it everywhere around my nose and lips and close to my eyes with no problem. However I do not use Retin A in cold dry climates or on vacations because of the changes in atmosphere and environment.	"Nightly use pea size amount. Wait 20 minutes after exposure to water (cleansing)
so that skin is completely dry."
2471	enbrel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatiod arthritis	Major decrease in joint pain , major increase in mobility. Everything else improved as well; my energy, ability to do everyday small tasks, my state of mind, and sleeping. I had always been a very active person. After starting the Enbrel, I could  jog again, ride horses, bike, play tennis, etc.	Occassionally, a slight itch at the injection site. The manufacturer also warns about  more susecptibility to infections.	Self injection twice per week
3504	maxalt	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	Maxalt relieved all the typical symptoms of a migraine within half an hour and i could keep going with my day where as before nothing would help. Topamax is my preventative but i still get the occasional that will push through and thats when i use the Maxalt, hence why only afew times a month.	slight fatigue and drowsiness but not enough to make me go to sleep.	"""I have had migraines for over 30 years. Have tried everything. This works the best almost every time. I&#039;d say 9 out of 10 times it cures the migraine and is a winner in my book."""
400	lantus	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insulin dependent diabetes mellitus	I experienced markedly improved fasting blood glucose levels, and greater stability of blood sugar before and after meals.  I had found with other treatment options, such as the insulin pump and the nph insulins that my morning blood sugars were always high, even with increased dosages.	The only side effects were increased weight gain and increased hypoglycemia in the late evenings/early mornings.  The side effect is because Lantus has a 22 hour duration after injection and as a result whenever I experience a greater than usual amount of activity, my insulin sensitivity increases dramatically.	"Treatment consisted of a morning and evening dose of lantus split up as 30 units in the evening and 15 units in the morning.  It took approximately two years of playing with the dosage amounts to find this as the ""best fit"" as all dosages either resulted in extremely low evening blood sugars or extremely high morning blood sugars.  Also, changes in activity result in severe blood sugar swings as well."
1114	effexor	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"The drug prevented emotional highs and lows.  Specifically helped with crying too much.  Lessened the intense ""caring"".  In some cases, it lessened it too much."	There were strange sensations when 2+ doses were missed. Certain sounds seemed exaggerated.	This was part of a treatment for Adult ADD.  I continued it for depression.
2410	synthroid	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Having been diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was only twenty, I was administered varying levels of Synthroid.  Prior to taking the medication, my hypothyroid condition was so severe that my metabolism was adversely affected.  Not only did I feel sluggish, but my liver was even slow to act because I started turning orange! My fingertips were calloused, my speech was slurred and my hair had begun falling out.  When the first dosage was given, it was too high.  Then when it was adjusted and my blood levels determined that it was the right amount, the symptoms all began to subside and slowly I became functional again.  I don't normally take any over-the-counter medications but as for this prescription medication, I need it to effectively manage my hypothyroidism.	Initially, when the dosage given to me was too high, I became a little jittery.  If the doctor prescribes the right dosage for you, there should be minimal to no side effects at all.	Synthroid (generic name: Levoxyl) is taken once a day, preferably in the morning on an empty stomach.  There do not seem to be any extra details concerned with the daily administration of the drug.
2033	protonix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hiatal hernia and ileocecal valve syndrome	I was told to avoid coffee, tea, chocolate & peppermint :'(  My hiatal hernia is tiny, but I feel fortunate that I was told about it before it got out of hand.  I feel 100% better 90% of the time, and when I don't, it's usually because I forgot to take my pill the previous day.  I would prefer for my pain to be treated by diet changes alone, but it's nice to have a pill to rely on.  It's my goal to control my pain naturally, wish me luck!		One a day  before the largest meal of my day, normally dinner.  Antibiotics for my Ileocecal Valve problem.
319	ativan	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	sleep disorder/anxiety	well, the main treatment benefit was that it did help me go to sleep faster, even better than the melatonin that I was taking before i went to bed. Another benefit of taking this prescription drug was that it helped me with my anxiety. I have considerably much less anxiety than I did before taking this.	there were no side effects.	1-2, 1 milligram pills per day as needed.
167	zomig	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	I usually wake up in the middle of the night with a migraine.  I take a Zomig immediately and usually within an hour the pain is gone.  I've been taking Zomig for over a decade and won't go anywhere without them.	The side effects were not that bad at all.  I'm a bit tired but nothing I would complain about.  When the headache pain is gone, a little bit of tiredness is nothing to me.	I suffered with migraines since I've been 22 years old and now I'm 59. No matter what medication I tried, it never took the pain away. A little over 10 years ago, I had a severe migraine while I was at an Acupunturist for a back treatment and asked him if he could do anything for my migraine and after giving him more information he came to the conclusion that my migraines are hormone related and he couldn't help.  He gave me a sample of Zomig and told me to try it and IT WORKED!!!  I was in awe and called him immediately to thank him for introducing me to this drug.  I've been taking it since.
493	meridia	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	overweight	Lost 15 pounds and did not feel hungry while taking the medicine. On days that I forgot to take a capsule, I did feel hungry and it was not as easy to stick to my diet.	There were no side effects that I could trace directly to Meridia. Mild constipation is a possible side effect, but that could also have been due to dehydration.	After day 9 on the medication, I no longer had that feeling of starving all the time. When I started Meridia, I also started the Jenny Craig program to educate myself on nutrition and get support.  My knowledge of nutrition was so limited that a nutritionist would not have been able to teach me such basic principles - I needed to be taught like a child.  I didn't know this at the time, but 4 monhts later, I know that was the right thing to do and why.
3175	prednisone	2	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	cornea transplant rejection	"60ml of Prednisone saved my cornea transplant.

saved the transplant."
1841	yasmin	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	contraception	pregnancy prevention	dry eyes, anal fissure - both were diagnozed by my phisicians. Initially I didn't attribute these side effects to Yasmin, but both improved dramatically once I stopped taking the medication. The fissure would heal for 3 year and I considered this condition cronic - but it healed within a months of me stopping Yasmin.	"""I am 22 and I&#039;ve been taking yasmin for almost a year and it&#039;s pretty much okay, my skin is clear and cramps and PMS are a lot better than before. Side effects though are weight gain (around 13 lbs) along with bigger boobs and everything which is really not great. Also I have zero sex drive which is making me feel bad. I am thinking about switching to a lower dosage pill but I&#039;m not sure about other pills because I have migraines and I&#039;m worried it&#039;ll get worse (yasmin didn&#039;t really affect it)."""
897	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The patient's was able to see positive effects in 2 weeks time.

The patient also noted that the desire to consume sweets or carbohydrates was markedly reduced during treatment.	Treatment was easy to administer, being only once a day, and could be altered easily (am or pm).

3486	diazepam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	stress	The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.	None to speak of except for slight tiredness.	To reduce pain generated by nerve irritation due to cervical radiculopathy, I take 2mg to 4mg up to twice during the day, and up to 6mg in the evening.

I stopped taking Doxycycline for a year and tried topical clindamycin and other potential treatments but none worked.  Therefore, I started on Doxycycline treatment again after a year as it had led to some improvement in my acne.  Within 3 days, I again had severe stomach acidity and cramping and had to stop taking it.	"50mg Doxycycline taken one at night with food, meant to be 2 - 3 month treatment for acne.  Unable to continue with treatment.

By the way, the most effective treatment I have now found for treating current acne is Freederm, a nicotinamide based product which is the only topical treatment I have found that improves my acne.  It does not prevent new acne outbreaks.

And the best treatment I have found for acid stomach is Barley Greens, better than all over the counter acid stomach treatments and better than Zoton."

My mood brightened, I stopped feeling grief and self-loathing, began to remember what I liked to do. I also had increased ability to concentrate, increased energy, increased sex drive.   I was no longer depressed.  I stopped taking the medication after a couple of years, and the symptoms of depression did not return.	I actually felt pretty upset during the first couple of weeks - shaky, a little manic and sensitive.  That did go away, though.  I also had occasional insomnia throughout.	I met with my physician four weeks after I began taking the medication, then 3 months later, then every six months. I did not attend talk therapy or receive any other treatment.

301	mirena	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	the treatment benefits were that i did not get pregnant nor did i get a period. occasional spotting but nothing a pantiliner couldn't handle.	the side effects are individual and unfortunately you don't know which ones will effect you the most. my personal side effects were horrible acne, weight gain, hair loss, extreme irritability.	"just like with any iud you wait for your menstrual cycle to start and have the device inserted then. this was three months after my children were born. approximately one month later i started noticing that my skin was starting to break out really bad, especially on my mid face down, neck, chest and back. i was getting very large cysts which i never had even as a kid. normal zits every now and then but never ones that would leave a scar. when treatments and products wouldn't help i called my obgyn and they told me that was ""a common side effect, sorry."" well over the course of the next few months i stopped getting a period but would know when my period should've been here because my mood swings were out of control. i would get so angry over nothing. and the next day i would get some cramping. i started keeping track of this and realized that these episodes were happening about every four weeks or so. i also have never felt so bloated and swollen in my life. i sometimes wake up and my fingers don't have any lines on the knuckles. exercise helps this, but i still can't seem to lose those ""last 10"" pounds. i've spoken to other women who have similiar if not worse effects than me. but the consensus is always that something negative happened after they got it."

Completely stopped crying jags (would get so down I'd cry over very little)."	Bad reaction with Alcohol. Allows me to drink more. Dry mouth when first taking.

703	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I have suffered from acne for 10+ years, and let me tell you, Accutane is the only thing that's worked for me.  Improvement in skin in days... clear skin in a couple weeks.  I have tried almost every treatment out there, and no results have compared to those I got from using Accutane.  Take it from someone who's suffered a long time: try it and you won't be sorry.  Be wary of some of the possible side effects, though.  I didn't experience anything too drastic, but everyone's different.	Dry skin and lips.  Just keep lotion and chapstick handy, and you'll be fine.	the doctors started me off on high dosage and gradually reduced it.  usually, it's two or three pills a day with meals.  also, one drawback is the monthly blood tests and dermatologists visits.  they are time-consuming, but worth it.

Not good to take this medication unsupervised.	Have a bulging disc.  I was given Carisoprodol to relieve the pain.  I took the medication for 2 weeks.  I actually needed it much longer but the side effects were too intense.  This medication does relieve pain but in no way cures injury.

I did not feel any side effects. my doctor regularly takes a blood test to make sure that there are no unseen effects but that did not happen for me.	I was advised to take 10 mg once a day in the evening after dinner. The only reccommendation was not to have grapefruit as that might affect the potency of the medication.
419	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	The imitrex I first took by giving myself shots, but now just take the 100mg tablets.  I no longer have migraines.

I stop using it after my face cleared up, WRONG THING TO DO. Once your face has cleared you still need to continue using it so your face can remain clear.	I got a whole lot of bumps on my face from using heavy amount of retin-a on my face. You only need to use a little to get the job done. It's very strong and needs to be put on very lightly on the bumps. Excessive retin-a will cause you to look worse!

3041	seroquel	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	insomnia	As a caregiver, I did not see any benefits, the patient continued to have problems with insomnia	The side effects of this medication in combination with the patient's medical condition and current medications were tremendous and in my opinion contributed to the patient's death.  The patient started having delusions as well as other bizarre behavior and the family could not convince the patient otherwise.  The patient was also on renexa which is known to be a strong inhibitor and I believe caused the seroquel to attain toxic blood levels.  The family tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss the problems but before this occurred, the patient went into v-fib miles from a hospital.  It was more than 20 minutes before the life saving crew arrived at the scene and even longer before the patient arrived to the ER for treatment.  The patient was pronounced dead on the scene.	Seroquel was added to my medication regiment after two suicide attempts on Prozac alone.  Once the Seroquel was added, I was able to feel calmer and the mood swings subsided as well.

1221	prozac	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression/stress	Having suffered with depression/anxiety after the break up of my marriage, during which I lost a huge amount of weight, couldn't sleep, was agitated, tearful etc etc. the fluoxetine initially helped me relax and gave me a 'holiday from myself'.  The effects totally calmed me, enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.  I regained my weight and although not totally free from the fluoxetine, have now cut down to every other day and have now been able to resume working.  My experience is that the fluoxetine have taken away the extreme mood swings.	No side effects as such.  However, the negative from my point of view is that there is an almost unreal calmness and lack of feeling/excitement/or even anger.........however as it is my intention to only use the fluoxetine for what is a relatively short term period, I beleive that this has been a 'symptom' worth experiencing.	20 mg once a day.
3487	diazepam	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I found that I actually felt worse rather than better, the only benefit was that with  imovane I could sleep at night which I couldn't do earlier. I never really felt rested though. I am not sure if the combination of these 3 drugs caused my anxiety to become worse. Venlafaxine was supposed to help my depression but I found it totally ineffective. I am wondering if I get a higher dose will it help but I am afraid it might make it worse . WOuld love to go off all of these medicines as I feel the side effects are worse than the depression	No energy, increase in anxiety and depression	"Morning Venlafaxine - 225 mg
night before going to bed - diazepam 2mg and imovane 7.5 mg"

To answer someone&#039;s question about how many OxyContin 80 ER pills can be prescribed per day. Legally, the answer is 4- 2 in the morning and 2 at night-which is what I receive; at one time they made 160mg OxyContin but they are no longer produced in the US.  To whomever said they were prescribed 8 of them a day- illegal or not from the US. It is an extended release medication meant to last 12 hours. I will be the first to say when they switched to the new for Formula, I didn&#039;t feel as though they were as effective and went from 2-4."""
174	depakote	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bi-polar disorder	Made the patient feel normal pretty much.	Depakote made me sleepy at first, so we switched the dose to nighttime instead of day and night.  Prozac, I have some ear pain from it.  Lithium upsets my stomach if I take too much at one time, so I don't.  I take one pill in the morning, and one in the evening.	I see a psychiatrist regularly.  He originally prescribed me Prozac many years ago, when I started seeing him after my husband left me abruptly alone with a three-year old son.  I felt like I was losing my mind.  The prozac helped calm me, but it was really when I began taking the Depakote that I began to feel good about myself, and anchored enough to take care of my son, who is now 19.
79	niacor	3	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol	I was not willing to deal with the effects of the drug three times a day and so I discontinued use.	There were no side effects -- but the expected effects were very intense -- a hot flush that moved from my face to my legs, and itching on my arms, legs, back, and torso.	Niacin taken in such a large dose opens the capillaries. This increases the blood flow close to the skin and releases histamines. The resulting hot flush and itching lasts for about 15 minutes.  It is an interesting experience, but three times a day is a bit much, especially during my at work dose. The red face was alarming my customers and the itching was a bit too distracting.
1171	nuvigil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	originally sleep apnea	Benefits were I was able to stay awake during the day. And now that I have esophageal cancer I strongly believe Nuvigil is a big help with the side effects of chemoradiation treatments.	I haven't seen any side effects yet.	"""I&#039;ve taken Provigil in the past for over 8  years due to severe IBDH &amp; shift sleep disorder.  When Nuvigil came out on market, my neurologist gave me samples to try.   I found it AMAZING &amp; much cleaner version, as I don&#039;t notice significant side effects.  Most importantly - the abrupt feelings when it first &quot;kicked in&quot; in the mornings and sudden halt from wide awake to severe sleepiness. Less agitated and very clean even transition from its predecessor Provigil!"""
3446	provera	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	irregular menses	The treatment benefits of taking Provera were very good. I had very irregular menses that lasted for long periods of time.  By taking the Provera day 15-26 of my cycle my periods began to normalize and become regular again.	The only side effects I noticed were during the first two days or so of taking Provera I was more tired than usual.  I also noticed I felt more bloated than when I was not taking it.	treatment commenced when the patient was only just 40,at which time the symptoms vere already beginning to be very severe.The daily doses were started at  that time,for a while premarin only,and after about a year provera was added,at the patient's requests,based on results of personal research which recommended a combination of the two.After using the drugs for nearly 20 years they were discontinued,the patient feeling they had been of great benefit.
389	seasonale	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	The benefits of Seasonale is that you only have your period once every three months.	In my situation, I continually have spot bleeding towards the end of every 30 day cycle which should not occur.  My doctor advised that this would lessen the longer I stay on this medication however, it only improved slighty and I never can make it through the entire 90 days, my period always starts a few days before I've finished the last few pills.	"""This is the first birth control I have tried, and so far I love it. I&#039;m heading into my third week being on this pill and so far I have experienced very minimal side effects, something I did not expect after reading such horror stories about this pill and others similar to it. I have had no spotting yet (fingers crossed this continues). The most noticeable side effect thus far has been breast tenderness. Its not unbearable-and usually an Advil helps-but they&#039;re definitely more sore than usually. This tends to vary by day as well. I haven&#039;t noticed any severe change in my mood, maybe a little more sensitive than normal, and definitely no change in my sex drive. I am loving this pill so far! Hopefully these side effects continue to be minimal."""
1348	crestor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	My total cholesterol was lowered from 237 to 165 in 4 weeks.

2397	synthroid	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Increased energy, ability to focus, and increased ability to lose weight.  Patient suffered fewer low blood sugar episodes.  Thirty pounds of weight were lost in the first year.	None, other than those stated above in the treatment benefits.	Patient has Hashimotos disease.  Prescribed synthroid.  Patient also working to follow a low carb diet, regular exercise, and normal sleep.  Over time, synthroid dosage has increased, to 112 mcg per day from the original dose of 50.  This is some cause of concern re: progression of the disease, but so far, no alternative approach/therapy seems to counteract this progression.  Blood work required every 6 months in order to help ensure proper dosage.
393	hydrochlorothiazide	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	Reduced the blood pressure with few side effects at first	dehydration - this problem grew as the years passed and I seemed to become more sensitive to the drug.  I finally started taking a 1/2 dose.  I had dry eyes, constipation, mouth breathing.   I would drink too much beer if I started drinking because I was so thirsty. Dry skin became an irritating problem.  This problem has improved since I changed medications.	The drug was very helpful at first.  It improved my concentration, my ability to focus and pay attention increased and I slept better.  As the years passed, I became aware that I was in a state of semi-dehydration much of the time.  This did not dawn on me until I had taken the drug for over seven years.  I started to keep water at my desk and drank a quart and a half on average every day just during the day at work.  This helped considerably, but the dry skin and constipation finally lead to my asking the doctor for a change.  I am curious if there is any connection between the dehydration and potential dementia.
3391	coumadin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	dvt	The clots eventually completely dissolved over the course of the treatment.	I had to be careful shaving my legs. I had to pay attention to which foods and alcohol would alter my prothrombin time and make it necessary to take a higher or lower dosage, i. e. be sure to have the guacamole if I indulged in a margarita!	"""Coumadin is very effective.  Home monitoring of INR with finger sticks helped with ease of use."""
3010	cipro	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	puncture wound	Cleared up the infection but any number of other drugs would have done just as well, without the awful side effects.	"Cipro can have a devastating effect on connective tissue.  In my case, loss of elasticity, leading to wrinkled, drying, aging  skin on face, neck, hands; suddenly visible veins; heightened sun sensitivity; easy bruising; weakened, painful knee and ankle joints, insomnia. I subsequently discovered that these are all too common ""rare"" side effects, among many others, and none of them emerged until a few days after finishing the dose.   Unless you have no other options, this is a medication to be avoided."	i was treated for a UTI with ciprofloxacin first; i took the medicine as prescribed exactly. within two days i started having symptoms described above. the doctor told me to switch to tequin, an analogue. the same effects occurred, only more severely this  time. i had to stop the medication after a few days, or it felt like i would have to go to the emergency room. i felt like i was dying. the week that i was on these drugs was enough to cure the UTI however. i recovered from the symptoms after about 5 days after stopping the meds.
120	valtrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	chronic cold sores	The first time I took it the cold sore ended up just slightly smaller than they usually are. The second time it was about 1/2 the size. The third time it got red and itchy but it didn't actually blister. The forth time I didn't take the medication because it was only the size of a small pimple. I used to get them about every 4 to 6 weeks but the last one came about 4 months after the previous one.	No side effects at all.	You take 4 pills as soon as you can tell the cold sore is beginning and then 4 pills 12 hours later.
2430	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hashimotos disease	Once I was diagnosed properly and began taking the synthroid, my dry skin cleared up, my energy level increased and my depression lifted.  My hair is now thick and shiny again.  I did not have weight gain so I cannot comment on that.	I did not experience any side effects.  My doctor is very hesitant to give me the generic version as there are many cmplaints that the generic version does not relive symptoms.	I take one pill every morning with a very large glass of water.  I must wait one hour before eating or drinking anything but water.  I take this pill at the same time every morning and it took about 2 to 3 weeks to begin feeling better.  I must get regular, every 3months, bloodwork to check thyroid levels.
2508	delestrogen	10	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	total hysterectomy	Keeping me from the effects of menopause.	I believe the benefits were to keep my skin soft, prevent sagging and wrinkles	Doctor told me I could take as little as 1/4 tablet per day if I wanted. I take one per day and I am very happy with the results. If I accidentally skip one day, I know fairly soon that I have missed it because I get chills or start to have hot flashes.
2088	anafranil	4	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ocd	Over time, this drug caused a massive reduction in my OCD hand washing rituals. I also no longer had to avoid public places for fear of germs.  Furthermore, clomipramine caused an immediate decrease in day to day anxiety and worry.	Inability to reach orgasm or ejaculate. Dry mouth.	I suffered severe depression and OCD.  Clomipramine was not the first drug tried, but it was the only SSRI to work for me. However, any benefits to SSRI drugs are countered by the havoc they play on your sex life.
1036	vyvanse	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adult adhd	I had increased focus the first day, and after a short trial of ritalin IR I appreciated the consistancy of the vyvanse, the medication didn't give me the same up and down emotionally (which is great when you are trying to lead a family) but i did give up some of the motivation that accompanied ritalin, I was hoping for the 12hr coverage but have settled into a routine,  of dose of 70mg at 7 feeling affects about 40 min later and then feeling foggy at 2.	increased b/p but it came down within a few weeks, dry mouth, appetite suppression, there was some increase of irritation grouchy feelings when the medication would wear off.	Diagnosed with inattentive type adhd as an adult. felt a huge relief. Started strattera for 2mos. with no improvement. then a straterra ritatlin combo.t felt the ritalin and real hope for the first timho, switched to vyvanse and titrated up to 70mg with symptom control for about 7-8 hrs, now taking a adderall booster of 30mg.
1081	effexor	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I'm not entirely sure it was effective at all.	It was really difficult to quite taking Effexor.  I had all kinds of panic attacks and severe depression when trying to quite.  I must have tried to quite a dozen times.  I think this is a dangerous drug.	I took Effexor once daily at bedtime for 3 years.
1272	provigil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	daytime drowsiness	Good cognitive enhancer.  I like that the effects come on very subtly and they also go away in the same manner.  I don't like to feel like I need a prescription which has no other (yet) proven benefits in long term cognition, I hope to either find another supplement to do something similar or see some research which shows Provigil has many more benefits than it does drawbacks.	Sometimes the sensation of racing pulse.	200mg once a day.
3883	abilify	2	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression not resolved with antidepressant drugs	While on abilify I can honestly say the depression resolved,	but it caused memory loss and again an incident involving retail theft. The retail theft occured while on just 5 mg of abilify. It effected my judgement/reasoning skills because I did not tell my doctor & allowed him to continue to increase dosage up to 15mg when I became expremely restless. Could not set down, paced for hours & called my doctor about this. Also during the 2 months I was taking this drug I charged a little over 15,000 on my credit cards that had no balance on them previously. If one did it was under $300. I still am currently unemployed & am having difficulty finding employement as a RN, due to my criminal record within the last year. If I had problems before taking antipsychotics, they were nothing compared to what I have now.	I am only taking ativan & getting psychological therapy & trying to get out of the legal mess the drugs seroquel & abilify caused me. It definitely made my life now & in the future much, much worse.
3551	femhrt	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	menopause	reduced hot flashes; reduced heart palpitations	mood swings; not enough estrogen	I started taking the drug 2 months ago to streamline a regime that consisted of taking estrodial and a progestrene cream.  So far, I feel it doesn't have enough estrogen to regulate mood swings and dryness of skin. I also have breast tenderness and continued heart palpitations. I think I prefer going back to activella along with the progestrone cream.
172	zomig	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	cluster headache	Moderate relief from headache. Sometimes complete relief from the headache where I can continue on without a headache for several hours.	Sometimes heavy breathing, palpitations, feeling of a rush of heat in the body.	I take 1 2.5mg orodispersible tablet. After 30 minutes to 1 hour the headache starts to subside. Sometimes I need to sleep after taking the tablet for the headache to completely subside.
1333	prevacid	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	indigestion	This was recommended to me instead of Gaviscon.  Supposedly it was a better solution for my indigestion.  Instead it was a disaster.	Terrible Terrible.   I already suffer from constipation, but I took one of these tablets, as prescribed, for two consecutive days.  After two days I knew they were a no-no for me.  My innards came to a complete STOP. I shall throw the remainder of the tablets away.  Four days on my innards are still at a standstill.	"Take one per day.

I have stopped taking them.  Don't forget I already take Dulcolax for my constipation, had I known these recommended tablets had a side effect of constipation I would have refused them.

It is back to the Gaviscon for me, it is gentle, pleasant to take and liquid.
Shell-like Capsules and me do not get along."
1190	prozac	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression with anxiety	"Within 3 weeks I noticed a ""lifting "" of mood and a general sense of being more energized and interested in everyday activities. I was far less concerned about things which had previously worried me and felt more enabled to engage in social activities again."	The drug was somewhat over stimulating leading to mild feelings of panic. If not taken with food it caused stomach burning. It dramatically exacerbated my insomnia and suppressed my appetite and libido.	The dose was prescribed in capsule form at 20 mg to be taken daily, preferably in the morning.
281	xyrem	3	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	trouble sleeping at night, tired during day	The patient did wake up more refreshed in the morning and didn't have to take the usual hour - 2 hour naps after work.  They didn't feel tired during the day anymore	"The treatment had very severe side effects : Extreme confusion - getting lost on the way home from work, mixing days up, not remembering how to do easy tasks like checking email. Emotional Changes - she would say ""I think I am crazy"" and cry."	I have been taking Xyrem for about 2 months. I sleep about 5 to 5 1/2 hours every night. I wake up between 3 to 3 1/2 hour after the 1st dose and then I sleep for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours after the 2nd dose and am unable to fall asleep. The weirdest thing is that I get a refreshing sleep every other day. On the days that I wake up exhausted, I am barely able to make it through the day and am hungry all the time. The next night, I usually sleep well and have a better day there after. I am going to stop taking it and I am going to explore other options such as Rozerem or Trazodone
2521	motrin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	headaches	I suffer with tension and headaches caused by stress. Headaches and tension in my back and shoulders, i find that nurofen is the only drug that will subside them releasing the tension and pain. Nurofen permits me to continue with my work or daily activities.	I suffer from no side effects when using nurofen.	Overall I'm very satisfied with the medication in it's efficacy and side effects profile. I only experience occasional side effects and in general the medication is very effective in treating and preventing menstrual cramping. However, the medication is best being taken before the cramping has started or immediately when the cramping starts because the longer you wait, the less effective the medication is, regardless the dose of the medication.
2224	allegra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe allergies	Almost immediate relief of allergy symptoms, freer breathing		I suffered from severe allergic reactions to almost all allergens.  My nasal passages would constrict & I could not breathe through my  nose.  As a result, my sinuses would clog up & I would experience severe sinus headaches.  Taking this medication only as needed -- when I began to first experience the severe symptoms -- has actually seemed to decrease my symptoms overall.  I don't need to use the medication as often as I did when I first began taking it.  In fact, my original prescription was filled 4/8/2007 for a quantity of 30 and I still have four pills left!
3733	lamictal	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar depression	The drug was very effective at first at getting me out of depression.

3677	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, mild depression	"Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex)."

Sometimes the reflux was so severe that I could not sleep. I changed my diet and tried many drugs, including ranitidine, Prilosec and Pepcid AC--none of whic helped.

With Prilosec, I occasionally had stomach cramping and nausea, but I did not experience any side effects with Nexium.	I took 1 capsule (40 MG) of Nexium daily for 30 days.

Since then I have slept only for about 12 hours (in six days), a nauseous feeling in my stomach with dizziness, stomach cramps, a permanent knot in my stomach, shivers, tremors and sweats, I am worried about itching starting  now.

2294	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The benefits were that once I started taking it, I became less emotional when I got upset.  I could handle the small things better than before, which used to set me off.  It evened out my moods so that I was less tempermental.	If I missed taking a dose, I would feel a bit lightheaded, dizzy or have a headache.  Too many missed doses lead to a really irritable mood.	After a break-up, I was very depressed and upset all the time.  I began taking a dose of 20mg and within a few days, noticed a difference.  I had fewer dramatic mood swings, and was able to handle the everyday things that got me upset in a more reasonable manner.  I did not feel like crying as frequently as before the medication, and I feel it helps me keep a pretty even temper.  I continue to take this medication because I have been told I have a natural chemical imbalance, and this keeps me from being overly emotional when it is unnecessary.  Overall, I feel I benefit from taking it, and unless I miss a dose, I have no side effects.

After a few days I was still getting worse and did feel  minimal comfort from the puffer, and my overall infection was getting worse. I went back to the doctor and they added in a Ventolin puffer to open the airways 2 puffs 4 times per day in between the symbicort. 5 days later I went back to the doctor wheezing more and with a sort of stuffy nose and serious nasal pain (mostly from coughing so much. He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system.. I took my first prednisone yesterday for the first time, it made me feel good for 9 hours or so but gave me some joint pain. The next day I felt a little better but still coughing and sick until I took the Prednisone again. (today at 2:00pm) It is now 11:00pm and I am flighing high (thats probably why I am writing in a blog and feel awesome, I feel like I could run a marathon. I also just drank a coffee and I don't think it helped. No coughing. Hopefully I can sleep tonight.. I used to take Ritalin for ADD and this kind of feels like that. I think tomorrow I will feel a little better, great again when I am on the Prednisone, and hopefully after that the puffer will Finnish off fixing the inflammation. Did anyone get hearing loss when taking prednisone? Its like when your on an airplane and your ears need to be popped but you cant pop them. I checked online and all I could find is prednisone fixes hearing loss..haha.. weird anyways.. Overall I think it works great!

3297	zoloft	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ibs, panic attacks, depression	Panic attacks and depression completely alleviated; true 'happy pills'. I wish I could keep on taking them indefinitely as I am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future, where I am unhappy and stressed, which can and does lead to depression and negative, sometimes suicidal, thoughts. I found Sertraline completely ineffective for my IBS.	After taking drug for 4 months I developed (for want of a better description) 'muscle jumps' (more severe than twitches and different from tics) which could occur in any part of my body, causing a literal 'jump' in the affected body part!  These only occurred when I lay down - usually when I was in bed, but didn't occur when I was up and about moving around.	I gave up taking Sertraline completely on my own volition as the condition was getting worse and although more irritating than serious, it started to interfere with my sleep.  The condition took around 2 months to completely disappear.

2628	depo-provera	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	Birth Control	Massive weight gain, 22kgs (?48pounds) in the first 3months. Massive mood changes, bacame very depressed (weight gain didnt help that one) Was emotional about the smallest things. Anxiety attacks. Angry over small things. Nightmares and sleep walking and talking ? if these are side effect of that drug but there was a definate increase in both (esp sleep talking) when i was on the drug. Increased appitite (the weight didnt come from nowhere) was warned about pos weight gain but was told that if you controlled your eating youd be fine but my hunger was crazy i would eat a main meal and 1/2 hour later be starving like i hadnt eaten all day. I found it really hard to control my intake due to my excessive hunger. I also had heavy spotting the whole time i was on it and for about 5 months after i stopped the injections. I guess it was a very effective birth control as i had become depressed, overweight, had my period the whole time and was more interested in food than sex. Over all was not worth taking it, i actually regret taking it, was devestating for a 18year old at the time to go through.  I also found it very hard to loose the weight during or afterwards, continued to gain weight for 6months after the last injection before any changes occured despite exercise and diet changes.	I recieved the shot at family planning about 3 years ago. Please do yourself a favor and look to other options before choosing this drug. My experience was the hardest 3 months of my life both emotionally and physically.
4004	celexa	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	when the drug actually kicked in, after about 10 days as i recall, it was an amazing experience.I got out of bed and was walking to the bathroom to shower. I was whistling!!!I stopped and thought, hey whats going on here. I realized I felt great, like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time.

111	celebrex	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	crohn's/colitis	The medication does seem to help with joint inflammation.  I find no real benefit for headaches or body aches.  There are some studies that show this drug may be beneficial for the treatment of polyps in the large intestine which may be a benefit for me in the long run.	None that I am aware of though I am cautioned by my Doctors that the fact that I have been taking this drug for a long time even though my dosage is not the highest, that it may have an adverse effect on my heart.	"My doctor prescribed celebrex to treat an injury i sustained while playing tennis. i damaged soft tissue ligaments/muscle tissue to the in-side of the knee, which became heavily swollen, painful and inflamed.
I was prescribed this drug as I am allergic to Ibuprofen based pain killers.

Initially I experienced slight tingling and intermittent dull ache to areas around the side, uppersides and rear of the cranium.
It felt like pulsing which lasted about 2 seconds before fading away. and continued the cycle ranging from 1 minute to 20 minutes in duration at different times of the day. this occured a day into starting treatment.
This gradually faded away within a week but came back weeks after stopping treatment. eventually subsided after a month or so."

I had no side effects.  Some people think the ulcerated scabby areas are side effects, but this is what the cream is designed to do, make bad cells react and destruct.	The cream is applied at bedtime for five nights a week for Basal Cell Carcinoma.  Three night per week for actinic keratosis.  You do this for eight weeks in a row.  By the end of eight weeks, the bad cells react gradually as scabby spots.  This is how you know the medicine is working.

Swelling of the foot was gone within 5 weeks.	I have not experienced any side effects.	I feel that it is definitely easy to contract a bad cold and then very difficult to overcome it, with the use of Enbrel. However, the benefit outweighs the liability. I would also recommend that the patient have good insurance. This medication is very expensive.

I am steadily losing weight--8 lbs. so far.  I also have the energy and desire to exercise, something that I couldn't do before.  I feel like someone handed me my life back!	It took time to figure out when to take the medicine.  From everything I've read, I am supposed to take it in the morning.  But, that made me wide awake, even at night, and it interfered with my meal schedule.  So, now I take it around 11 P.M.  I still sleep well, something new for me, and can easily wake up, feeling alert throughout the day.  I've NEVER felt this way before.  It's awesome!

1321	prevacid	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	acid reflux	I suffered from acid reflux symptoms which included mild stomach upset and a full feeling after eating. Prevacid eliminated these symtoms very effectively to the point that I did not need repeated doses of over the counter anti-gas medication and antacids.	Taken daily, Prevacid unfortunately caused severe side effects which included dizziness and a woozy feeling like I was over medicated. The side effects were so severe that I often was unable to work and needed to lie down and occasionally took a nap.	It took several days for the medication to start working, but once it did I felt better. I have to take one pill everyday with food for 4 weeks.
1450	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	peripheral neuropathy	I suffered chronic pain and sleep disruption because of the PN of unknown cause (not diabetes).  I also suffered mild depression because of the chronic pain.  Cymbalta began to relieve my symptoms almost immediately (and the depression as well.)  I still have pain,sometimes better,sometimes worse, but this drug in combination with others (see above) as well as consistent exercise has helped tremendously.	The gabapentin, which I was taking long before cymbalta, made me sleepy, but on the day after a night of disrupted sleep, the fatique can be overwhelming.  Also, for the first six months or so, I had a lot of gas and stomach rumblings.  When I first started on cymbalta, I felt very spacey and light-headed but that passed after a couple of weeks.  My internist thinks my blood pressure is up slightly because of the cymbalta	Two 60 mg. capsules first thing in the morning.
3238	nuvaring	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	"Easy to use. 
Highly effective."		Nuvaring is a very easy to use method of birth control. Even though the instructions advise you to take the ring out for three weeks, and have a ring week free after, my OB/GYN recommended that I leave it in for four weeks and on the day the ring should go back in just put a new one in. I only have my period every three months on this method, and have not experienced any side effects.
300	vivelle	6	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	total hist	Decreased hot flashes, minimal mood swing and axiety.	Severe appetite loss and some weight loss.	Ive been on the Vivelle patch about 3 month's now. Prior to the patch I was on a sublinqual tablet but that wasnt working so I tried the patch. Te only side affect fromthe patch is severe appetite loss. Some days I have no desire to eat at all not even a craving. This is starting to concern me considering that I'm not trying to loose weight at all. Ive lost about 3 pounds already and about 115 pounds at 5ft tall so this is a problem. Wondering if anyone else has experianced this and have any suggestions? Spoke with the pharmacist and he stated that it may go away but try it for another month. He didnt sound to sure about it either.
375	lamotrigine	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	None.  Had to discontinue use after three days because of severe side effects!	Within hours of taking the first dose I had vaginal itching.  Since I read that was a side effect in the paperwork, I didn't think much of it.  After two doses, the itching turned to a burning and sourness in the pubic area.  I thought it might have been irritation from wearing leggings with no underwear (from the seam).  The medication was taken at bedtime.  When I woke up after taking the third dose, I had blisters on the outer labia.  Late that night, while on an hour+ drive home from a nearby city, I was in severe pain.  The blisters got worse, severe headache, severe backache, chills and all over aches like the flu.  During the drive, I felt so bad I was praying for my life so I could continue to raise my children, even though I do not believe in god!  It is now the next day after that horrendous drive.  My blisters continue to worsen; my entire pubic area is sore, itching and burning; and I have developed a swollen lump on each side of my pubic area that is extremely tender and painful.  I have not taken my temperature but I'm sure I have one.  I feel like I have the flu plus all the gynecological problems.  I'm no doctor, but I highly urge any woman on this med that they discontinue use IMMEDIATELY upon ANY gynecological disturbances, no matter how minor you think they might be.  The goose eggs in my bikini area continue to grow and become more tender.	My neurologist that prescribed the med told me to see my primary gyn if symptoms are not gone a week after discontinuation.  Isn't that nice!  I live in a rural town and don't have an established gyn right now so it just is not a good situation.  BEWARE!!!
2419	synthroid	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Although the medication has decreased my TSH level, I am still fatigued and inspite of being active at my job, I cannot seem to lose weight.

657	seasonique	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	have not stop bleeding		Bleeding not even Spotting	"Ladies: I am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking Seasonique (PLEASE do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. I would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. I normally have 4 - 5 days menstrual periods every month. But I was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described 4 periods only per year (WOW! what a great idea, especially I have small child, school, work, and husband). Guess what happen since then? I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

Final words...... Good luck if you are on this prescription, and I hope you win, if not, you defintely need these words ""Good Luck""! :)"

You have to be very careful with the dosage and slowly increase it, but it is completely worth it.	For the first night or two taking the medication and after increasing the doasage I had trouble sleeping.	Lamictal saved my life. I suffered from severe chronic body pain for 3 years, and naturally I searched for a physical cause but was never able to be diagnosed or treated correctly. Finally I was diagnosed with depression and began taking Lamictal. I felt a 180 degree difference in my life immediately. I started initially with 50 mg and slowly titrated up to 200 mg. Now I can sleep at night, I am not fatigued during the day, I can complete tasks and have motvation, and most importantly, I am completely pain free.

Started taking the Flagyl and it made me feel lousy.  Nauseous, vomiting, feeling as if I had the flu.  Discovered that the side effects lessened if I ate something substantial (especially dairy products) before taking it.  I was determined to persevere to get rid of the abscess.  This did not begin to subside until the fourth day of treatment, but it did go completely by the seventh day and has not returned.  This was one month ago.

2490	mirtazapine	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety and depression	Mirtazapine was very effective in treating chronic insomnia. I was not sleeping due to severe anxiety and moderate depression. The drug has significantly improved anxiety symptoms and is gradually lifting mood and reducing depression symptoms	"First week I experience fairly bad nausea, first month I was sluggish and tired and head felt ""foggy"" but persistence and going to a full dose resolved all of the problems. Only ongoing side effect is moderate lethargy."	"""Mirtazapine is amazing in the fact that it has no negative effect on libido, and positive if your libido was low due to the depression.  I also take ADHD medication so the side effect of hunger is not an unwelcome thing, should note that at higher doses (30mg ) it works more as an antidepressant and around 15mg it has a nice effect on appetite stimulation and sedation to sleep.  You don&#039;t feel as if you&#039;re in a fog, you just feel &quot;balanced&quot; I suppose.  You feel emotions but they&#039;re not as extreme, doesn&#039;t have that zombie effect.

I had chest pain and swelling of the lips and eyes.  I had to immediately take benedril to stop the drug reactions.  I felt nausiated for days after the adverse drug reaction.	I had been taking Prevacid for years with success and no adverse drug reactions. I had to switch because my insurance would not pay for the Prevacid any more because there was a Generic form of Prevacid.  I tried the generic but it was not effective so I was given the prescription for Nexium.  The Nexium was effective but I was highly allergic to it.

3426	tazorac	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	age spots on hand	I had gotten severe age spots on my hands, probably from spending many years driving long distances each day.  My hands looked worse than anyone else's my age (or older!).  My hands now looks pretty good/very good!	As the age spots scabbed up, they peeled off, and left my hands red, raw and sore.  One night, the burning feeling was so intense, I had to wash it off.  I was quite worried, as this medicine was out of date, and I thought perhaps it had become dangerous.  Originally it was prescribed for my daughter's acne, but I had read online that it might be helpful for age spots.	I applied a small amount, probably more than I needed to, to the back of each hand for several nights in a row.  Before many nights had passed, I noticed that the skin around each age spot was beginning to become dry and peeling.  Before long, the age spots just seemed to peel off, as did some spots that were more like small moles or very dark freckles.  Although I was concerned that I had severly burned and scarred my hands (they looked very bad for more than a month), now they look great.  In fact, the left one, which was the worse one, improved more than the right hand!

1362	lupron	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	uterine fibroids/heavy bleeding	The drug stopped my menstrual periods and put me into artificial menopause.  The hope was that it would trigger my body to go into menpause and stop the heavy bleeding associated with my fibroids.  Unfortunately, my period came back approximately 2 months after the last injection	Hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness.	I was injected once a month subcutaneously in my abdomen just below the belly button.
1215	prozac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ocd	Patient expressed decrease in compulsory acts and a general improvement in mental stability. Also to note, patient showed a general improvement in social and educational functions as expressed in an academic report.	Increased insomnia with a decrease in appetite, as common with this medication.	The patient was asked to participate in active counseling in addition to the medication. Some of the compulsions appear to correlate to stress induced anxiety, so the patient was urged to stop, breathe, relax, before attempting a stressful (or habitual) activity.  I also found it necessary to inform the patient of the current paradigm on his condition as well as offer alternative treatments.

3252	cleocin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	My acne improved when accompanied by monthly exfoliation peels.	My skin was very sensitive to sunlight and it was difficult to protect my skin given the sensitivity of creams to cause acne flair ups.	Application of creme to clean skin in the morning and evening. It was the most effective acne treatment I have used that didn't cause excessive drying or irration to my skin.
1987	viagra	4	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	erectile disfunction	Viagra did help me in acheiving an erection after prostrate surgery. Other methods that were offered were not as attractive at the 3 times daily dosage of Viagra.	Dizzyiness and flushing of the skin. The side effects became worse the longer I used this drug. I became too dizzy to be able to drive and preform my job.	I was given Viagra to correct ED after a racial prostate surgery. The side effects vs. the benfits of Viagra were not worth it.
2718	elavil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	tension headaches	Actually the Amitriptyline greatly helped with getting to sleep each night as an added benefit. It is an antidepressant but used in this case to break a cycle of tension headaches. The pattern of tension headaches was broken and the headaches have not since returned. It also acted as a migraine headache preventative.	It does cause drowsiness and so had to be taken at night. It also causes a dry mouth. It felt to me as if it were also slowing my metabolism down but this was not measurable in the time frame.	One tablet per night for three months.

3872	levoxyl	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	thyroid disease	The benefits I received from treatment with this Unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests, TSH, T3 etc. which was ordered by thyroid specialist. Another benefit from Unithroid drug was that the goiter which I had developed prior to Unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again.	My freaking hair has fallen out to the point that I am almost bald in front and around the front edges of my hair. My hair has been falling out since I began treatment with Unithroid and continues to shed today. My hair is practically bald in front and the hair on the the top and back of my head has fallen out so much that the once extremely thick hair I had is now thin, and breaks easily. From the hundreds of complaints I keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web, it appears that I am not alone in my dilemma, but to date, myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease. Other side effects are sometimes depending on what I eat or the time of day, my pulse starts racing.	Pill is taken early in the morning on an empty stomach.  It is basically prescription iodine as hypothyroidism is basically an iodine deficiency.  Symptoms that I experienced were basically weight gain and extreme fatigue.  It's taken awhile to get the dosage correct, and after switching pharmacies and getting a different drug manufactured by another company, I feel that maybe another blood test is necessary to confirm that the new pills are as effective as the others I had been taking for 5 years.

776	naproxen	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	shoulder pain	Somewhat reduced the shoulder pain. My should still hurt when I moved my arm certain ways but it was somewhat lessened.	I could not sleep. I had trouble falling asleep and would awaken wide awake many time during the night.	the treatment was for a frozen shoulder.  I had a lot of pain and could not sleep at night on my back or side. I could only sleep sitting up for a few hours at a time. It was hard to move.  Physical therapy eventually helped and taking Tylenol products.  I had many sleepless nights.  I went off the medication after three weeks since the effects for me were not helpful and had terrible side effects.
2386	synthroid	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidism	The synthetic thyroid hormone treatment made it so I was at least able to function, sped my metabolism up enough to keep warm and have regular menses.	Side effects come from taking either too little or too much Synthroid. It is a tightrope balancing act and the blood work is not specific enough to guide the clinical course.	"Compared to others who naturally have a functioning thyroid, it is clear to see that Synthroid is an inferior product to what the thyroid makes naturally in a healthy individual. I know that I still have minor hypothyroid symptoms even when my blood counts show that I have therapeutic levels of the medication. Additionally, generic versions of Synthroid seem to be even less effective at relieving all the symptoms, even though the blood counts could be normal. With hypothyroidism becoming a very common condition these days, one would think that new medications would be coming out, but the medical professionals seem content to stick with Synthroid because ""on paper"" it seems to be safe and effective."
357	neurontin	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	neural pain	Addition of neurontin reduced overall pain severity at the neuropathic injury site (R cervical spine), and appeared to lessen a qualitatively different component of the pain to that helped by tramadol. Combination of tramadol and neurontin in carefully tested comination (to suit patient) brought best pain result to date (injury 26mo prior).	Possible dizziness and fatigue, but this is unclear. Both symptoms were present prior to the injury, but were mild, and have worsened with the addition of each of the three medications. Patient also has a secondary depression following the injury, which combined with the injury itself also confound a clear attribution.	Added 300mg b.i.d. on gradual increase to 1200mg daily, but found 900mg was sufficient.
75	flexeril	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	muscle spasms	Muscle relaxation took about 2 days to be effective.  Pain reliever was effective in numbing the sensation initially, but after 2 days relief was found. 4 days was far better and 6-7 stopped taking every day.	Drowsiness was an issue, but this did improve the sleep time which reduced stress and allowed blood pressure to lower.  I do not like to take medicine, but I can see how easy it is to rely on these to feel relaxed and numb!  It is frightening when I hear about people taking these every night and not think about treating underlying cause of muscle tension.	The two medicines were used in tandem to offset the excrutiating pain in neck and shoulders due to muscles spasms. Chiropractic care was also used, but the pain was equivalent to childbirth contractions and after two days of no sleep and increased stress, medicine was sought.  The medicine took another two days to offer relief that allowed sleep, but after 4 days the muscles were relaxed. Chiropactic care continued and yoga was restarted to resolve the underlying problems. After 6-7 days medication was stopped. 1 night of the following week required medication, but since, none needed.

I basically went from a full head of hair to half bald in a span of 3 years.Also arthritis type pain between joints if you take too much for too long. Sometimes i had to lay off of it for a few weeks to regain my strength. This stuff has some serious side effects. Men feel the side effects much worse then woman do.	make sure your doctor prescribes you 800 mg because its wayy cheaper because you can cut them in half if you want because they are tablets. Its like the same price as the 200 mg for the same count so its really stupid to get the lower dose when you can just cut up the higher dose.
3153	prednisone	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	pneumonia with associated cough	The drug really did help the inflammation of the lungs and cut down on the cough.	Stomach upset,hunger, which lead to overeating, severe acne breakout of the face.	In addition to whatever antibiotic I was currently on, I was to take 9 mg. of prednisone -- the first few times, it was 3 mg with each meal, but that was really too much, so later we did the three tabs all at once in the morning -- a day for several days, sometimes as few as 7, sometimes as many as 15.  Then, I had to taper off the amount I took for several days, in 3 mg increments for a few days each new dose.  Finally, I would be off it.  This time.
3736	lamictal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ptsd	According to my psychiatrist and to what I had read, lamictal could be very helpful for people with PTSD. I had tried dozens of meds over the years and, at the time, was totally crippled with anxiety despite being on all the other meds. listed above. Hours after starting Lamictal I was given relief and the anxiety and dissociative symptoms reduced markedly.	None that I noticed	titrated up from 25 to 100. was given the generic after the titration to 100.  the generic was not good. felt way more manic. got back on the brand name and doc suggested bumping up to 150.

186	adderall	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	attention deficit disorder	Able to concentrate on school, work, movies and everything else that might go into a day. Able to become interested in hobbies and follow through with them.  People treated me differently.  The horses even treated me differently!  This medicine changed my life.  Gained the ability to remember things from conversations to classwork.	Hair loss.  Weight loss, which is nice at first but changes to malnourishment after a few years.  Relationships changed because I was no longer able to be manipulated.	I take 3 Adderall per day. 1 1/2 pill in the morning, and 1 1/2 in the the afternoon.  Each pill is 15 mg.  I break one in half to divide between morning and afternoon.  I see my doctor once every 3 months to discuss how it's working.  I started out on 5mg, 2x/day, but I developed a tolerance to it over time and went from 5 mg/2x day, to 10mg/2x day to 15mg 2x/day to 15mg 3/day.
1935	zithromax	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bronchitis	Zithromax was uesd to cure the bacterial infection that was located in my lungs. The drug also cured a minor cut infection.	There was no after taste or smelly urine like penicillin provides. This drug caused yeast overgrowth. While it killed the dangerous bacteria in my lungs it also killed all the healthy flora located in the intestinal tract and the vagina.	I took the zithromax for 5 days, once a day with two dosages on the first day just as prescribed.  I rested for the first three days and experienced a great improvment in my condition.
38	zyprexa	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Went from severely depressed before starting the medication to almost entirely free of depression a week after starting the medication; helped with insomnia.	drowsiness in the beginning, but I quickly got used to it.	I entered a hospuital six years ago for suicidality; I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating (I had anorexia nervosa), and I was extremely depressed. I started taking 10mg of Zyprexa the first night I was there. I was really drowsy all the next day, but it waned over a few days (now it doesn't affect my energy level at all.) In about a week, my depression just lifted. This medicine has worked miracles for me- I've been depression-free since starting it- and I wouldn't go off it for any reason.
4099	chantix	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking	Tried to stop smoking for years. Started using Chantix and found that if taken twice daily even if I smoked an occassional cigarettes; I continued to take the drug. Had no jitters or nervousness from nicotine withdrawals. Very effective.	When fir started taking the drug had mild nausea after medication. This went away after a few weeks.	2 pills a day as prescribed.  I recommend it, but results obviously vary.  A few friends have also used it with identical results.  None of us take *any* other medication, which may be a substantial variable.  So far no suicidal thoughts or rages.
995	armour-thyroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	much more effective than synthroid in raising body temperature, relieving fatigue, and weight loss	none	After trying Synthroid and Levoxyl (both T4 only, no T3, and both synthetic rather than bioidentical), and also for a while adding Cytomel (T3 only, also synthetic) over the course of about 3 years and having erratic results, little reduction of symptoms, and difficulty stabilizing dose, I asked my doctor if I could try Armour, since my mother, who has been hypothyroid for most of her life, found that brand to be her best choice.  My body responded immediately.
2145	caduet	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	cholesterol/high blood pressure	apparently lowered cholesterol and blood pressure	"Awful!  Difficulty sleeping, extreme fatigue.  Weight gain. Swollen knees, ankles and feet.  My knees were severely affected -- difficulty getting up and down stairs, could not get out of a car by myself.  When I stopped taking the drug, my knees improved to the point where I am freely ambulatory, but they are still stiff with some pain.  I have had to consult an orthopedist, who tells me he has seen MANY such cases.  X-rays show I have the knees ""of a person 20 years younger,"" but the muscles have been grossly affected."	In place of the Caduet, which I stopped against the objections of my internist, I am using natural substances such as policosanol, CoQ10, and pycnogenol.  I am also losing weight, and have professional therapy to try to regain strength in my knees.
749	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	nasal allergy	For many years, every Spring I would get very troublesome nasal allergy symptoms--tingling,burning, itching, sneezing, etc. After a few days, these symptoms went away. It really surprised me because I had tried many other medicines that didn't work, that also caused severe drowsiness and dry-mouth. Some years my symptoms were so bad that I couldn't go out to a restaurant or movie because I was sneezing so much. Taking this medicine gave me my life back!	I experienced no side effects at all from this nasal spray. This was great  because I had significant side effects from all the pills I had ever tried for my hay fever/nasal allergies (dry mouth and drowsiness).	One or two squirts of the spray into each nostril once a day during allergy season.
254	ultram	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis pain	I stayed loose and limber throughout the day.  Didn't end up limping at the end of the day or after a 30 min car ride.

None of the side effects that narcotic pain relievers give.  No tiredness or spaciness	At first, it caused itching, but now I don't have that.  If I take it close to bedtime, I can't sleep.	two 50 mg tabs twice a day.  Usually at 0900 and 1700

2409	synthroid	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	TSH went up to 51 when put on low dose of natural thyroid. Doing better on synthroid rather than generic brand.  Still have fatigue, memory, weight loss problems.  I believe there are things that the blood tests do not show. Not freezing anymore.	Still have temp below 97.5 though I don't feel cold.  Difficulty losing weight.  Hair thinning.  Tired much of time though I use to be a very high energy person.  Dr. doesn't seem to believe me, but I know my body.

758	flonase	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	eustachian tube pain	i have had eustachian tube pain in my neck for about 2 years most days, and almost everyday this last year.  this is the only thing that has ever worked to relieve the pain, and as a benefit it helped with some mild allergies.  LOVE IT	full doses would make my heart race, so i use typically just 1 spray in each nostril a couple times a day, and more if i havent taken it in a while, and all of a sudden the pain sets back in unbearably.	"""Since childhood I&#039;ve had intense seasonal allergies. They get so bad that my throat itches terribly, my nose runs profusely then it clogs up completely. Worst of all is how bad my eyes get red and tear up and itch and hurt all the time. It&#039;s a nightmare allergy wise living in south Texas because of the cedar pollen. I did some research and saw that Flonase is a type of cortical steroid so I bought some. Kenalog40 shots have always been my savior but since I lost my insurance I&#039;m stuck with OTC. Tried Flonase as per the instructions. Within days every allergy symptom but my itchy red and runny eyes went away. I waited two weeks but no relief for my eyes. After doubling the dosage my eyes cleared up and now I&#039;m allergy free. Flonase rocks!"""
236	wellbutrin-xl	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Within 3-4 weeks I had no depression and less hyperactivity; I was better able to organize my work and accomplish daily tasks; it regulated my sleep cycle. I told my husband that this must be what 'normal' (non-depressed, non-ADHD) adults feel like.	A small amount of shaking, mainly felt when drinking from a cup. It's not supposed to affect weight and hunger, but I have gained some weight, though I don't know if or how the medicine contributed.	Started taking anti-depressant when my Mother passed away.  Started a low-dose and increased over a period of 3 months.  I believe Wellbuterin was very beneficial and did not have major side effects.  I stopped taking them 2 months ago and haven't had any withdrawal symptoms.
344	neurontin	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	degenerative disc disorder, spinal stenosis l1-s1	Ability to sleep 8 full hours without waking up in pain was fantastic!  No need to get up during night to void, also fantastic.	Excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and retaining information, craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia, among others.	Initial 300mg was taken for only 2 days, due to severe daytime sleepiness in AM.  Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours, so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up, minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep, I still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect, I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit, I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after 8h was easier.   But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in AM, and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening, I am too tired to study for my classes.  Overall, I would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work, or adults who can take naps during work hours, or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.  I am hoping the upcoming RFA procedure will allow me to stop taking the narcotics and neurontin, and allow me to be able to work, study and retain what I learn in class (especially short term memory).

1877	doxycycline	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	infected throat and lung	The drug relieved the sore throat and lungs, albeit within two or three days.  I continued to have coughing fits only at night.	The side effects were moderate, however the medication should not be taken prior to going to bed.  I had an irritated esophagus and horrible indigestion for a full day and a half because the medication did not dissolve correctly as I had lied down.	Took Doxylin 50 mg once daily for 3 months.  Improved acne during that time.  However after stopping treatment. Acne came back.  Was also using oil-free based cleanser twice daily at the time.  Avoided oily foods, ate heaps of fruit and veg.
2210	advair-diskus	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	copd	At first it helped.	I did not realize at first that they were side effects. I thought that my chronic bronchitis had gotten much worse. Then I began to develop bouts of extreme fatigue, anxiety and occasional panic attacks that had nothing to do with COPD. Then I started to have choking fits. They were becoming so serious that I feared choking to death. I suspected Advair, so I tried not taking it and then taking it again. The cause was identified and I stopped taking Advair. The choking fits ceased. The fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). The chronic bronchitis improved dramatically.	"I was diagnosed with COPD about 12 years ago. I started taking Advair about eight years ago. During the course of treatment I tried Spiriva, but had to stop because it was very drying. At one time I was taking Singulair, but that didn't seem to do much of anything. So I quit that. Throughout the entire period I have used Duoneb and Zyrtec. I think I was originally put on 250/50 Advair. That was increased, some years back, to 500/50, and about two years ago reduced back to 250/50. At all times I used the Advair twice a day.

My pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when I developed side effects, nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when I had to stop using Advair. I went to another doctor who treated me for adrenal fatigue and had me take natural anti-inflammatories and mucolytics to replace the Advair. I still take Duoneb and Zyrtec. I stopped taking the Advair one year ago. I am just now recovering from the adrenal problem. My COPD has not worsened."
122	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	genital herpes	"After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours."	To be honest I have had no side effects that I can determine.	"1 tablet a day in the morning.
If symptoms beginning 3 tablets three times a day for 5 days or until symptoms have disappeared."
3969	norvasc	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypertension	lowered blood pressure to within normal limits	none that I am aware of	Apparently, this will be long-term treatment.  My doctor and I had several conversations over high blood pressure.  Though I have increased my exercise routines, there is not a positive impact on my blood pressure.  After 1 month on Norvasc, my blood pressure was within the normal range.
1326	prevacid	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	I can eat and drink more normally without as much acid reflux and vomitting.  My condition results in slow digestion and intollerance of some foods.  With prevacid, I eat small amounts and avoid irritants.  I have had refluz episodes in my sleep.  With religious use of prevacid, this rarely occurs.  I can eat a larger variety of foods. It has made a positive difference in my quality of life.	I have not experienced negative physical side effects that I am aware of.  This drug does not aid with digestion of food.  I still have nausea and vomitting but, not because the drug doesn't work.  My doctor explained my other symptoms result from food in stomach several hours after eating.	I have tried every prescription medication for acid in stomach and had gall bladder removed.  I have modified my diet and avoid irritating foods and drinks.  With prevacid twice daily (normal dosage is once daily) I can eat and drink with less nausea.  Without it, my diet would have to be clear liquids and pulverized solids.  It has made a tremendous positive difference.  I do not want to stop taking it unless something better is approved.  It is not a treatment for the paresis.  Reglan is the only FDA approved prescription drug for my condition that I am aware of.  I cannot use it without horrible side effects.
1549	methotrexate	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	psoriasis	Relieved the plaque psoriasis which was over 90% of skin and extremely uncomfortable.	Vomiting and nausea on days the drug was ingested, rebound effect(return of plaque) when attempting to decrease the medication;  liver blood levels need monitoring while on the drug.	Patient had onset of psoriasis and was treated with topical steroids.  Psoriasis quickly spread over entire body and methotrexate was recommended.

3870	levoxyl	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroid	My hair had been falling out, and it finally stopped after taking this for a while.  Now it is growing back and getting thicker.  Before I was always cold and my hands would even get numb from being so cold all the time.  Now I am finally warm and don't have to wear a sweater  in the summer.	After I take it in the morning I feel nauseous unless I eat something when I take it.  It is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, so sometimes I do this, but feel queasy for an hour or so.	This is something that I will probably continue to take.  Even though it makes me a bit nauseous, the benefits greatl outweigh the risks for me.  It is so nice to be able to be warm again, and for my hair to be growing back.

1279	provigil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	shift work sleep disorder	I worked rotating day/night 12 hr shifts for 15 years and I was always tired and it was difficult to keep awake and a focused mind while working, especially on night shifts. I've been taking this drug for 6 years now and I have no problem staying awake, sharp and focused. I no longer even drink coffee at night when I'm at work. This drug has changed my life.	When I first started, I was taking 200mg before shift. It gave me the jitters and a headache. But when I went to 100mg that took care of that problem.	Recommended dose is 200mg once a day, can also be taken again in the afternoon if needed.
3246	nuvaring	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	It was nice to not have to worry about a pill every day, you can put one ring in and then don't have to worry about it for 3 weeks.	I noticed that I felt really down around month two of taking in, my mood swings were severe, I felt tired ALL THE TIME. I could also feel the ring during sex and it frequently came out during sex.	ALthough it is convenient, it almost defeats the purpose of birth control if you have to worry all the time that the ring is going to come out. also, mood swings and feelings of tiredness were almost unbearable. would not recommend it.

It helped me most during stressed situations of any size. I could handle anything and not get angry.	Mild headache and mild stomach ache	I take Cymbalta for depression and anxiety.

3026	seroquel	9	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Mood was more stable. Better quality of sleep.	For the first few days of the use of Seroquel I had very bad nightmares. My nighmares felt so real that I almost stopped taking the medication. After about two day the nightmare just turned into very vivid dreams... sometimes very pleasant dreams. Seroquel also makes me urinate more often so I drink more water to stay hydrated.	I was diagnosed with PTSD after several negative incidents happened in my life. There was a point when I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin. The doctor started me on Seroquel... a very high dose at first, 300mg. Later when I found out about some of it's very negative side effects such as TD, I started taking only 100mg a night. And soon I will try to lower that dosage.

Then the dose went up to 20mg/day for another 3- 4 months, when no 'anti-depression' effects were noticed, the dose went up to 30 mg/day, it made no difference either. I have stopped taking it gradually (20mg/day for 1 week, then 10mg/day for 3 weeks) until i stopped completely. Now I'm waiting to see how I feel, to see if I 'll try another medication, since the side effect described above was intolerable to me.

2806	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants."	At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive.

237	wellbutrin-xl	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/dysthymia	Wellbutrin has been very effective for my low-grade depression. I have tried many other antidepressants in the past and have found them to be ineffective and/or causing too many side effects (weight gain, sexual side effects, fatigue, etc.). Wellbutrin actually helps me maintain my weight and has minimal sexual side effects.	Side effects included mild nausea and shakiness. These side effects disappeared after about two weeks.	I have been on Wellbutrin for four years and will probably continue use for several more years.
1660	climara	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopausal	Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.	The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal.	After all these years on climara patch the pharmacy changed my patch to the generic brand and I'm having extreme swelling over my entire body, legs, feet, hand, face.  It is awful.  I will contact my doc today.  Could the change from Climara to the generic cause this?

Finally, I found a doctor who gave me a prescription (just a few years ago, I&#039;m already an adult) and the Doctor prescribed Zovirax 200 mg 5x a day for 5 days. When I am able to take the medicine as soon as I feel the blister forming, the blister will only last for a day; it will grow and then burst and crust over within twenty four hours, so I&#039;ve never really had to take the medication for more than 2-3 days.

However I quickly lost about 10 lbs and couldn't stop moving around.  Eventually my thinking became jumbled (I don't have ADD).  I was constantly thinking in circles.
2805	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Nearly complete control of bipolar condition, except in times of stress. It worked very well for me, even though I tried almost all the SSRIs over the years.	Dry mouth became a problem after years of use. No other side effects were a problem.

This is the first medication that has worked for any length of time. (Paxil worked for a short period of time but maxed out w/o further benefit even with augmentation).	The worst side effect I had was insomnia. At first, insomnia was OK because I was, for the first time, happy to be alive and being happy more hours of the day seemed hunky-dory. Of course sleep-deprivation isn't good for the brain and started to wear on my job performance. Tried many different sleep agents to no avail. (I have absolute tolerance to anything ending in -pam apparently). For the longest time I could sleep no more than 1-2 hours per night (but felt rested). I'm up to 4-5 hours (pre-med normal amount) without any sleep meds.	"""I have been dealing with Bipolar II for most of my life without realizing it was anything more than depression with some bouts of super focus and productivity. After being diagnosed and trying a few different treatments that had worse side effects than the depression we tried Emsam at the 6mg dose. Almost overnight I noticed a massive improvement. While I tend to go into hypomanic states more often with this, it is controllable and I am more than happy to have this as the major side effect.

When fertilizing my garden, the wind kicked up and blew the fertilizer all over me. After washing it off, the skin on my midsection (around the stomach area) began to itch and turn red. Shortly afterwards, blisters appeared and the skin began to be infected. My doctor prescribed Cipro, which not only did not work but caused my lips to be extremely swollen, so swollen that the skin on my lips split in a few places and bled. I could actually easily see my swollen lips by simply casting my eyes downward. I stopped taking the Cipro and reported the condition to my doctor, who was at a loss to explain why the Cipro did not help my skin infection.

Thereafter they continued to grow for a few months till they reached a maximum. Then I carried on with maintenance doses.	Just the itchy eyelids. Other than that there was occasioanlly a very slight burning.	I was told to use it once a day at night and to apply it with clean brush.  It is important to try to keep the bottle from having direct contact with the skin in order to avoid contamination.  I used a new eyelash brush daily and Latisse contains once a day applicators.

On the sexual function side of things I have noticed a decrease performance wise, I guess there was always going to be a tradeoff.

Orencia alone gave mild improvement in symptoms of severe rheumatoid arthritis. (I had extensive and severe joint pain and inflammation, severe edema in legs due to knee inflammation, and had very limited mobility.) Within 6-8 weeks of beginning Leflunomide (and still continuing Orencia), symptoms began to decrease significantly, and my lab values improved dramatically. As I write this I have very little pain and inflammation, and much more mobility than before - even considering the joint damage I've sustained. Recently, I tried reducing my dose of Leflunomide to 10 mg/day. After 4-6 weeks or so, I began to have more symptoms. When I resumed the 20mg/day dose, symptoms decreased dramatically again - in about 6-8 weeks.	"I have some GI distress, but am not sure if it's directly due to Leflunomide or to a long history of taking RA medications which also negative have GI effects.

I had a very serious eye infection last year which resulted in corneal scarring and loss of much vision in one eye.

Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications.

In the 3rd week we had plans to go to a wedding out of the country, and I required wheelchair assistance at the three aiports we went through to get there. I would have missed my flights if I had had to walk.
793	ambien	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	I had two arthroscopic surgeries to my right knee with little relief or benefit from the surgery. I was prescribed Ambien 10mg at bedtime as needed to help me sleep. On the nights I didn't take the medicine, I woke up all through the night. With the medicine, I slept well and soundly.	The only side effect I recall, which was very minor, was a sluggish feeling, only if I didn't sleep for a minimum of 7 hours. This was only on one occassion.	Post surgery to my right knee I was in considerable pain, and suffered insomnia because of it. Ambien 10mg was prescribed as needed at bedtime. I took it nightly for the first 3 nights post surgery. On the 4th night, I didn't take it, and woke up all through the night. All in all I took the Ambien a total of 7 out of the first 10 days following the surgery. It helped me to sleep very soundly and the pain didn't interupt my sleep. I had no ill effects from it at all. I still have the remaining 20 tablets that were prescribed one year ago.

374	lamotrigine	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	seizure-1st and only at age 41	Allowed to drive again after build up to therapeudic level	Initially, very tired in evening but that subsided within a few weeks. After that, I noticed small bumps on my whole scalp where follicles were-if I scratched one, a tiny white hard follicle emerged  and a hair never grew back at the site. Although the thinning was noticeable to me, no one else noticed and the neurologist didn't agree that the medicine caused hair loss. Luckily that side effect subsided within 3-6 months.	Took 12 weeks to get to correct level and couldn't drive during that time
3	nasonex	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sinus polyps	After polypectomy, kept polyps from reforming to a large degree though I've never regained my sense of smell except for periodic whiffs of gasoline, etc.	I had no reportable side effects though I might sneeze a couple of times after treatment and sometimes have mild sinus drainage, I assume of the drug itself.	Treatment is simple. I only spray in nostrils twice a day.

I feel much better, with less pain than before.  I was very pleased with my checkup when I went to my doctor.  I feel the combination of the Fosamx and the Caltrate Plus
will continue to improve my condition and make my bones stronger."	They said I could get sick to my stomach, particularly if I didn't stay up for a minimum of 1/2 hour after taking this medication.  I am not allowed to lay down, as that will cause the sickness.  I also have to wait at least 1/2 hour before taking a drink of juice, coffee, tea, etc. This drug can also cause heartburn.

1862	augmentin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	earache/sinusitis	After the first day on this drug, my ear pain was gone.  Sinuses cleared soon thereafter.	While taking augmentin, I had trouble sleeping.  When I did finally fall asleep, I had very vivid, strange dreams.  Also noticed mild vaginal discharge.  Some dizziness, but nothing major.	I feel that this med did the job of clearing my sinus infection and ear pain.  Side effects were bearable.  I would take it again.
1678	claritin	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	well controlled seasonal allergies and improved breathing.  I was able to use this medicine for allergies but also noticed that my general breathing, especially while working out, also improved.  Years later I was diagnosed with reactive airway disease instead of asthma.  I had noticed I had a much harder time jogging during the seasonal changes until I started taking the Claritin.  Then running became much easier, so it now makes sense to me that the Claritin helped so much.	none that I recall - was before claritin became OTC.  I really liked taking the claritin because I had no side effects, unlike some other allergy medicines I had taken earlier, and unlike some OTC I had tried earlier.  When taking the Claritin I felt that I was not really taking anything.  It was just easier to go about my daily routine and enjoy sports a lot more. I have really appreciated how Claritin has helped me.	The treatment details were very simple as far I can remember.  One pill once a day.  I stayed on the Claritin for at least three years.  I do not recall any side effects or problems during this time.  Eventually it seemed as if I didn't have any allergies because I had gotten so used to the positive effects of taking this medication.
3674	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety and depression	Brought me out of a severe, didn't-care-if-I-lived depression without making anxiety too much worse. Not perfect but works well enough that I don't want to quit taking.	Starting it and titrating up caused interesting side effects: low blood sugar, big pupils, palpitations (all were temporary). Now if I miss a dose, I get bad night sweats and wierd dreams, and quickly remember to take it again.	Started at 37.5 mg for few days, then 75 then 112.5 then 150mg. Did well initially, then was increased to 225 mg several months later. Tried 300 mg for a while but not much difference from 225. Will have to taper down if I ever stop the med.

2715	elavil	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. Therefore, I have continued to take it for that alone. While I still on occasion have problems falling asleep, I find I can combine it with Melatonin or Valerian. In 12 years, I haven't had to increase the elavil dosage.	None.	I started to have it after a nervous breakdown due to panic attacks. First I had 3 tablets a day, but then, with time went by decreased a number of tablets. I still need it two-three times a week when I feel heaviness in my head and it helps in 1 hour after taking it. Highly reccomend for those in depression, with the tension headache and difficulties with sleep.

2365	propecia	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	male pattern baldness	It effectively slowed my hair loss dramatically. My barber of 15 years says my hair has not changed. I notice slight loss over the years, but I still have a lot of hair whereas I would most certainly be bald without it!		I have to take 1mg/day to stop hair loss. I did not notice results until recently after having taken it for 6 months and I am hoping to notice even more once I have been on it for a year.
3234	nuvaring	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	I did not need to take a pill everyday. There were less side effects compared to the amount in other birth controls. My painful cramps went away.	I gained weight, had migraines, and I had mood swings.	Although I did not enjoy the side effects of this birth control, it has been the best method I have tried. Very easy to use and it helps for when you have forgetful tendencies.
3316	desonide	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	exzema of the face	the treatment benefits was that the skin irritation did go away for awhile. I thought that I had been cured of the skin rash. It cleared my skin up and gave me relief from the rash.	It turns out it did not cure it at all but possibly hurt my face.  It also may have made the condition spread to other areas of my face because in time I had other areas of my face where the rash was.  The cream was only a temporary relief to a deeper situation. If one is looking for fast relief it will help but it covers up an initial problem that needs to be addressed.	I saw a few dermatologists and each one told me to use it twice daily. I was even given different forms. One a cream and the other a foam.  I was also informed to use them for two weeks and then stop. I did, and when I stopped my rash slowly started coming back.

3396	clobex	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	contact dermatitis	Clobex was effective in resolving minor contact dermatitis. It soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. Use continued for six months with no results. The rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of MRSA was made. The Clobex, due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. Use was discontinued and Bactroban and Septra DS was highly effective at clearing the infection. Have since had no need for Clobex and have used alternate methods for any incidental dermatitis that may occur. For those who chose to traditional medications, I can recommend Clobex for mild to severe dermatitis. I was satisfied with the results, except for the misdiagnosis of Skin MRSA, yet glad to know from experience, the difference between these two rashes.	none	"""The spray is amazing...only thing that will clear my scalp...Right now my scalp is in a mess because my insurance will not pay on it and it is $400 for a 4oz bottle...I can&#039;t afford that."""

I was very satisfied with the results.	There were no side effects from taking this medicine.	I took the medicine once a day in the morning for 14 days.  Whenever heart burn reoccurs I repeat the treatment.

Since I caught it early, my doctor prescribed me Tamiflu. I started it right away and the first dose made me so nauseous, dizzy, and I experienced vertigo. I was considering stopping it but I had heard great reviews about it; I also had taken the first dose on an empty stomach. For the next couple of doses I made sure to eat something before taking Tamiflu. From doing this, I had no nausea or dizziness. It could be a coincidence but I think it really made a difference. It definitely shortened the duration of my flu."""

1248	sotret	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	the drug permanently cleared my acne.  i no longer had breakouts...not even blackheads.  my skin was very dry which i suppose for someone with oily skin this would have been a benefit.	"extreme dryness, redness, flaking, chapped lips, and occasional lower back pain.  i used aquaphor twice a day all over my face and lips.  this is the only way i could look ""normal"" because my face looked like it was literally peeling off."	Doctor prescribed 2 weeks of antibiotic to clear off my break out with some antibiotic cream and of course sun block, followed by roaccutane 20 mg for the first two months 1 capsule a day and after seeing a good result he advised me to maintain a low dose of one every other day for another eight months. That was the maximum dose I can take after which calculated against my weight.

3877	levoxyl	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	hypothyroidism	I am not sure if it was levothyroxine that helped to normalise the hormone levels.

Levothyroxine (25 mcg)was taken 30�60 minutes before breakfast daily, for almolst 2 years. The doctor told me, that i should take it as long as i live.

1698	retin-a-micro	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne	This cream was very beneficial for the treatment of acne and some blemishes.  I had many pimples around my mouth after getting waxied there and nothing was helping.  Further as soon as one pimple went away another formed.  This cream began to work within several days.  I could tell that the pimples were getting lighter and new pimples that were forming would hardly enlarge because I applied the cream as soon as I saw a new one forming, many of them disappeared without even leaving a blemish affterwards.	I had no side effects because I was applying the cream correctly; only before bedtime and washed them off in the morning.  However I heard of some other person whp took the same cream but was not aware of those instruction and instead applied it in the morning and  had her face exposed during the day.  The cream worked somewhat for her but the spots where she applied them stayed irritated and would turn red when the wind blew in her face.  This condition remained for several years afterwards for her.  THIS CREAM CANNOT BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN! Otherwise it works beautifully.	The treatment was very simple.  At night (and only at night!) I cleaned my face with a mild cleanser or atleast with water and did not apply any other medication before hand.  Afterwards I simply dabbed a very small, thin layer of the cream over the pimple and allowed the cream to dry and then went to sleep.  In the morning I made sure to wash off the cream before going outside.  For very sensitive skin the area may turn red but this is temporary and simply means that instead of applying each day one must use it every other day.
1470	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic tension headaches/ mild depression	"My Dr. prescribed Cymbalta to treat my chronic tension headaches. I was on Lexapro for a little over a year, but gained about 30 pounds. Due to the excessive weight gain I gradually went off the Lexapro. Well- about 5 weeks later my headaches came back. My Dr. reccomended Cymbalta b/c it ""weight neutral"" and also has pain relieving properties."	I haven't experienced any typical anti-depressant side effects with Cymbalta (dry mouth, nausea, heart racing, figgity). The only thing I have noticed is a few hrs after I take it I get really tired, and could use a nap. So, I'm going to try taking it later in the day so I don't crash in the middle of the day.

Upon taking the pill for a month, I found that my periods did become regular.  In addition, the pill has so far prevented unwanted pregnancy.  The only side affects I found were slight weight gain.  However, this is easy to overcome with excercize.  Therefore, I feel the benefits outweigh the side-effects of taking this medication.

1609	dapsone	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dermatitis herpetiformis	Dapsone treated the intensly itchy skin condition quickly and efficiently.  A gluten free diet alone did not relieve this condition.	The side effects after one year have been a slight decrease in red blood count.  There has also been an onset of shakyness which I believe has been a side effect.	2-100mg tablets are taken at bedtime.  The dosage is self medicating, which means that if the condition is under control I can lower the doseage to see if the contrlo can be maintained at a lower dose.  So far, after one year, I have been unable to do so.
3223	nuvaring	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	contraception	Required only one application per month, rather than having to take a pill everyday. Was also a lower dosage than the pill, which seems better. Because it is not ingested there was no nausea.

To make it stick better, rub your skin with alcohol and let dry.  Press on for ~20-30 secs.  Really the only thing I find frustrating is the fact that by the 5th day my body is clearly not getting as much medicine, and I start having body symptoms to parallel this.  Also have very sore knots in my breasts, especially the first few days.  But other than this, it has been a life-saver since I have post surgical menopause."""
3102	ortho-tri-cyclen	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birthcontrol	Of all of the birthcontrol pills I've taken this was by far the one with the least number of negative side effects and it actually had several positive side effects.  It helped control my acne and kept me thin.  After several years I did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after I stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).  I found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  I learned the hard way.	I never got pregnant.	I took the same little pill for 21 days and then the placebo pills for another 7 days of the month.

Christ, if I didn't have leukemia, I just wouldn't even go to doctors. I mean, their ok if you need to get put back together after an accident or something, but most of the time they, and their petrochemical nostrums, just seem to cause mote problems than they cure.	3 pills a day for two weeks, symptoms came back, took it 4 more days and then, knowing what would be in store for me if I took it; I found that I could not force myself to take even one more pill.
2181	carac	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pre cancer cells	Carac is used once a day as a topical cream in order to remove pre cancerous cells.  It did a great job of removing all bad cells.  I used it before going to bed.  I only used it 2 weeks because I had the reaction quicker than most.	The side effects are that your face becomes very red - like a bad sunburn.	You put the cream (Carac) on the bad cells whereever they may be, once a day for three weeks.  Over time you skin will have a reaction, become like a bad sunburn and then begin to peel.  Carac will only attack the fast growing bad cells.  I had a great reaction to Carac so it worked extremely well for me.

After seven days or even less I was already feeling better. One benefit is that the cure can be taken orally with no downtime. It did not cause any side effects but sped up my recovery.	I did not experience any adverse effects when I took this drug. The only effect that I experienced was that it made my fever go down and cured my tonsilits. However, I know of people who do not react well with Amoxicillin and  are allergic to it. I do not know what sort of adverse effects they might have experienced.

When dosage was increased the side effects became unacceptable.  I took the medication for a week and then could not stand it anymore.  It was preferable to go without sleep than to take this drug.	Dizziness, dry mouth, extremely dry skin, highly increased urination, memory problems.	"I was prescribed this drug for insomnia.  My MD told me that it had been used as an anti-depressant, but didn't work well for that, but was good for insomnia.  She originally prescribed 25 mg, and suggested I work up from that if 25 was ineffective.  I am very drug sensitive, so when 25 mg. really knocked me out and I could barely wake up the next day, I cut the pills in half, and that seemed to work--but I just gradually got the effects mentioned above.  I realized later that I had taken the same drug, higher dose, under the name Desyrel when I was 43 for post partum depression.  It didn't work, and it made my blood pressure go down--the number I remember is 77/44.  Same reaction--very sedated, confused, etc.  I would never have taken it, but it was not identified as Desyrel, even on the pharmacy information sheet, so I didn't realize what it was.  The weird thing about this drug (for me) is that it makes me so confused, but subtly, that I can't think clearly enough to realize what is happening until it gets pretty bad.  I know I am very sensitive, and this may be a completely idiosyncratic reaction, but I don't think so.  When I talked to the pharmacist about it she said ""Yeah, some people just can't take it.""  I know people who take 300 mg a night--and they are fine!."
1982	fiorinal	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	headaches	This drug does an excellent job of relieving my headache pain.  No OTC drug comes anywhere near reducing the pain like this prescription does.  What I used to do for headache pain is lay down in a darkened room with an ice pack on my forehead.  If I could fall asleep usually the pain would be gone when I woke up.  Problem is that it is not always possible to find a quiet, darkened room when a headache comes on.  This prescription relieves pain completely within 45 minutes.	"I feel kind of spacey for about an hour after I take it.  Do not recommend driving, or trying to think or make decisions during this time.

In addition, I am worried about getting hooked on it.  I find now that I am taking these pills more often.  Also, I notice that now I cannot tolerate headache pain without these pills... same pain as before only now I just can't handle it at all."	I have (what I think is) sinus-related headache pain.  Pain is always in the forehead on the right side.  Changes in barometric pressure always bring a headache on.  Sometimes the pain is so bad I vomit.  I had sinus surgery (drilled holes in sinus cavities in forehead... sorry I don't know the medical terminology).  This relieved the headache problem for about 5 years, but it is  back again.  I think I would rather have another surgery than continue to take these pills.

3590	differin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	After a few weeks my skin started to clear up and look my younger and clearer.  I did experience some tightening in my skin and dryness.  Also, I was instructed not to apply any moisturizer to my t-zone since that is my problem ares.	My skin felt dry and tight at times but my skin adjusted after a couple of weeks and I'm not experiencing any dryness now.	applied the gel in the morning and at night on nose, cheeks, forehead, and chin.
1139	methadone	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	opiate dependence	"I have been able to maintain sobriety and get my life back on track.  Methadone has allowed me to get my ""bearings"" underneath me, and really focus on what is important in life once again. After about 6 months, I began working and have been promoted consistently since then.  I am currently tapering and am really trying to be smart about it.  While I am very eager to be off methadone, I also do not want to rush it.  I feel that methadone should be one of the last options a person looks to when trying to stop opiate use because it isn't something that can be stopped whenever a person feels ready.  I have found it to be quite a complex task."	WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN!!  I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism, or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago. It is likely a combination of both.  I have also seen a sever decline with my teeth, and the only cause I can think of is methadone.  I have taken such good care of my teeth, as far as self care and making sure I see the dentist every 6 months, and that still hasn't helped.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I have started having sever pain in my joints as well, especially my knees.  I can honestly say though, that without this medication I probably wouldn't be alive to experience any of these minor side effects.  Without a doubt, methadone along with the therapy I received while in the clinic and my families support has saved my life. I will take the weight gain and minor discomfort any day, at least I am here to write about it.	Ten Miligrams daily.  Of course, at first you have to deal wiht the clinic, but take-home doses are easy to earn as long as you're doing what you're supposed to be doing.
262	ultram	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	budging disk in neck	For the most part the pain was taken away just enough that I could function.  I like that it's not a narcotic, yet gives some of the benefits of one.	Because it only took away part of the pain I thought it would be OK to take 2 more tablets.  That was a really bad idea.  I started to feel pressure in my head, I felt like I was going to faint, my lips started to tingle.  The worst effect though was that about 3 min after my heart started going extremely fast then started skipping over and over.  It was very scary.  I then read that a person can die from and overdose.  I feel like I dodged death.  Very important! take this as prescribed.	Ultram helps control fibro pain without making me sleepy or feeling 'out of it'...there aren't many drugs I can take that I can still function and actually feel well, with Ultram or Tramacet do this for me....only down side expensive, not covered under blue cross
1479	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain and depression	after taking 30mg for 4 days i realized in the middle of the night that i no longer had any pain any where in my body. before my whole body hurt. i'm thinking i must have had fibromyalgia. i still have no pain and therefore am able to move about more easily. i'm hoping this will last. i can't remember a time in my life when i had no pain. i also noticed that my hot flashes have all but deminished.	i noticed i was more tired during the day but i do believe that is beginning to wane. but i seem to be ok as long as i am active. it was well worth it to have no pain. this has been awesome.	i started on 30mg once a day. i take it at night when i go to bed otherwise it gives me restless legs. after 2 weeks i started on 60mg. that has only been 2 days so i don't know how that is going to affect me yet. i do feel a little more light hearted.
435	imitrex	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	"Imitrex was the miracle drug for me at first. Suffered with migraines since the age of 7 and never got relief except through ER shot of stadol/phenergen starting at age 27. So when doc gave me imitrex shot the first time I thought I found my miracle. 
It does get rid of the pain completely. I have no complaint about that.
I used to only get migraines once or twice a month."	"A bit tired feeling...sort of lathargic or weak feeling.
Here is the bad for me. Since taking imitrex, the frequency of migraines have increased. I got rebound from this drug everytime I use it. It'ts totally ridiculous to find a drug that gets rid of the pain but I cannot use it anymore due to it's effect on frequency. I've tried all the other triptans and only imitrex has worked for me but I can no longer take it."	Again about the rebound effect. Some doctors refuse to admit that this drug causes rebound headaches but for me it did. I took nothing else...no OTC drugs or anything else for the headach. ONLY the imitrex. When I realized what was happening I stopped taking drug and just suffer through as I used to. That's the bad...the good is frequency of mograines are much less.
4058	amoxil	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	throat infection	sore throat went away, cough cleared up; maybe it would have anyway, but at the time it seemed wisest to avoid getting a worse lung infection than letting it heal itself.	stomach upset, nausea	To the best of my recollection (its been a while), the dentist(s) prescribed the 'standard' 2 - 4 500 mg. tablets to be taken 1 hour BEFORE any invasive procedure and the same dosage directly AFTER the procedure: cleaning, extraction, etc.: varying with dentist or procedure. I followed that procedure.
2996	restoril	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sleeplessness	Sometimes it makes the difference to stress- related sleeplessness.	I am aware that it is habit-forming, so I use it less often than I would like. If I take it late at night, I can feel sleepy next day	Swollow half a pill.
1426	adipex-p	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	over weight	the doctor told me that this medication would suppress my appetite as well as increasing my metabolic rate which would assist in weight loss.  As I only had to lose 10kg I am not sure that I was the best candidate.	"I was warned about blood pressure, kidney, and liver problems, I was told to look out for the shakes and a general feeling of being ""on speed"".  I admit the only side effects I felt was a slight case of feeling light headed, I found I had a lot more energy."	I have found this medication worked quite well for me but I only lost minimal weight but it did help me develop better eating habits.  At first I was hesitant as apparently it can disturb blood pressure and as I was using minoxil at the same time but I have not experienced anything bad from this.
1592	xanax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/depression	I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.	lethargy, loss of appetite.	I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression.

1714	retin-a-micro	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti-aging, acne	The treatment benefits included Skin Regeneration, and decreased Acne.  My skin felt more smooth and the pigmentation was disapearing.  Overall, the goals were accomplished however the redness of the skin took over.	The side effects of the treatment included Redness, Dryness, Skin Irritation.  The skin was very dry and difficult to moisturize.  The skin looked red and irritated.   However, when I switched to a lighter skin cleanser, Cetaphil, this really helped improve the redness and dryness.  Prior to the Cetaphil i was using Roc cleansing pads which were too harsh on my skin.	My routine included Daily use of Micro Retin A pump.  I applied the Retin A Micro pump to my entire face at night after washing my face.  I used a moisturizer and sun screen in the morning.
890	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I believe that I suffered from depression my whole life.  I feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if I had some treatment for my feelings.  My whole family would agree that I am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life.	I am not sure if it is only the drug but I have almost no sexual feelings. Could just be my age...who knows.	I was diagnosed with mild chronic depression.  I took Prozac for approximately two years but it began to no longer work, even after raising the dosage.  My doctor switched to Paxil.  I tried getting off of it on two occasions, but both times, after about two months, the depression returned.  Paxil continues to work for me; however, I am concerned about potential long-term side effects.

434	imitrex	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	I have taken Imitrex off and on for over 15 years. I have migraine headaches. Typically one tablet of Imitrex gets rid of the headache, usually within 30 minutes.	Side effects seem to vary. Sometimes I have body aches (almost flu like) for an hour or so. There is also sometimes flushing. I do become fatigued. Within four hours, all side effects (and the migraine!) are gone.	One pill is taken at the onset of the migraine.

1752	topamax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	I was suffering from migraine headaches for more than 40 years, since a teenager. Topamax has reduced twice weekly migraine headaches to approx. 3 or 4 times a year for severe migraines, although I still suffer from chronic, but infinitely much easier to bear, daily headache. I am thankful for the use of this (originally) anti-seizure drug for migraine prevention.	Mild loss of appetite. Loss of interest in alcoholic beverages.	For the past six years of treatment, via a neurologist, I have been adjusting the medication from 400mg to 600 mg per day, to the current dosage of 400mg per day, in a divided dose. One tablet am, one tablet pm. I would recommend Topamax to anyone suffering with chronic migraine as the primary drug treatment, with additional rx with triptan meds.
3471	ambien-cr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I did go to sleep more easily. I'm not sure how effective the time release is, because I often would wake up 4-5 hours later. Sometimes I didn't take it to sleep, but upon waking at 3pm, would take one to go back to sleep. They say to not take unless you have 8 hours to sleep, but this is not the case with me. The cutoff time is 4-5 hours.	I sometimes feel groggy the morning after. The one time I took it nightly for 3 weeks, I had been under a great deal of stress, and then jet lag (I travelled to Europe). In addition to the grogginess, I also just didn't feel good.Very hard to describe, but a bit rundown and not clear-headed. For occasional use, it is better than the alternative, though I'm not sure I believe the time-release is worth the cost. Next time I'll try the generic.	Treatment is 12.5 miligrams for an indefinate period of time.
1696	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	blackheads,large pores,sun damage	I saw measurable difference in reduction of blackheads and pore size. I was also really happy with the evening of pigmentation. I had sun and age spots as well as freckling and  saw a huge difference in the lightening of all these problems.  My skin had a much better over all tone a seemed to become firmer over time.	The first few weeks of treatment my skin was peeling a little and I had some red splotches but eventually these symptoms went away.	I would wash my face in the evening with a mild cleanser and then every other night when my face was completely dry I would apply a small amount of Retin-A to my face with the exception of the immediate eye area. The evenings that I did not use Retin-A I would use a good night moisturizer.
1720	retin-a-micro	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Made skin moderately better for a few months	Made skin EXTREMELY dry and flaky, almost unbearable, even moisturizer couldn't fix it	When I first started using it, it made my skin really irritated and it was super itchy and dry, it was flaking like crazy. It was the beginning of the summer, so I didn't have to worry about school, but if it was during school, I would have been so upset.  After about a week or so, it remained dry but the flakiness went away. My skin started clearing up, but it was still oily, and I still had bad blackheads and I continued getting pimples.  After a while, it started spreading to my cheeks, which used to be super clear, and even though most of the pimples were gone, they left dark spots behind.  After about a year of still having bad skin, I decided I'd go to my dermatologist and get something different. They put me on Solodyn, Atralyn and Aconya, which completely fixed the dryness the Retin-a-Micro gave me. I wouldn't recommend Retin-a-Micro, it makes your skin feel super bad.

767	periostat	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rosacea	The drug prevents the pustules that can result from Rosacea.  When I do not take the drug for a week, the pustules tend to reappear.	When I first started the drug, I felt nauseated for a few days.  It gradually subsided.  It helped to take the drug with food, although I initially was told to take it 2 hours after eating.  Now I can tolerate it better, but still must take it at about the same time every day or it bothers my stomach and I get nauseated.	My Rosacea had progressed to the second stage (pustules) before I was diagnosed.  I woke up one morning with pustules on my face, and one was infected.  I went immediately to a dermatologist, who diagnosed me with Rosacea and prescribed 200 mg of doxycycline daily.  I tried that, but my stomach would not tolerate it.  He lowered the dose to 100 mg, and I did better, although it took a few days to adjust.

However, I was forewarned that Valtrex has the following side effects:  headache, gastrointestinal discomfort such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea,constipation, abdominal pain,indigestion).  Also because I was taking Valtrex to prevent outbreaks triggered by laser treatments, I was advised that Valtrex causes sensitivity to UV light and my skin would be much more vulnerable to sunburn even during very short exposure to UV light."

183	adderall	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	attention deficit disorder	My attention span was incrementally increased, as was the intensity of my focus. Also, while taking the drug, I noted a significant decrease in my appetite, which subsequently induced a fair amount of weight loss.	I experienced heightened levels of sleeplessness while on the medication. In addition, I was constantly concerned about my ability to study and perform while not on the medication. While this is not a physical side effect, it is a very real emotional one that caused me some stress.	After noticing that I was having difficulty being attentive during my high school classes, experiencing an inability to sustain focus on one thing at a time, and was unable to finish assignments on time due to these two symptoms, I decided to see my doctor. He asked me a variety of questions about my current state and the problems I was having, and after listening, prescribed a small dosage of Adderall to alleviate these issues. After taking the first dose, my concentration increased ten-fold. As a result, my grades went up. I discontinued my use of Adderall upon my college graduation, and have found that while I still suffer from symptoms of attention deficit disorder, it is having a decreased effect on my adult life.

After a long process of elimination to find out the cause I stopped Zyrtec and my hair came back.  This also happened to my teenage daughter.

1893	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anti-malarial	I did not contract malaria and I also noticed some increase in the clarity of my skin.

I starting taking it several days before leaving and took it daily while there and for 1 month after returning.
364	neurontin	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic pelvic pain	Essentially there were no identifiable treatment benefits.	The main side effects were fatigue and dizziness, which became worse with increasing dose.	This medication was intended to reduce patient use of narcotics by providing adjunctive treatment of chronic pelvic pain, as indicated by several studies. I have also prescribed it for neuropathic patient. Most patients experience no benefit, or if there is any benefit, it occurs at small doses. Titrating the dose up seems to worsen side effects without providing any added benefit. In addition, it is a costly drug.

I had gastrointestinal upset, including diarrhea, cramps, and nausea. Since I took a combination of drugs when beginning treatment, I am not sure which one caused a weight gain.

Side effects include dryness, some flaking, some redness, and some tightness.	I used this every night after cleansing my face. I waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before the application. It was also recommended by my doctor to wear sunscreen the next morning since this medication causes skin sun sensitivity.

I decided to end the medication as it was not doing anything as a life benefit. this medication simply masks symptoms so that the patient ""feels"" functional.And most importantly, I no longer trusted it. I also now believe that DSM diagnois, as used in the general public (myself included) excuses inept doctors from forming medical diagnosis, doing the investigative work and testing to EXCLUDE biological conditions. Why do I think this? My 14 year old daughter ""mentally crashed"" and it was her thyroid, which affects among other organs THE BRAIN. My thyroid tests has been flucuating, but, since the medical doctor stated "" I don't know if I should treat you for hyper or hypothyroid....I got dumped into DSM and prozac. A travesty."

This medication stops a severe headache and it rarely returns.  It works within about an hour.  It stops a migraine that may last for two days at times.  I am not a big fan of taking medications but this one is a miracle drug.	I rarely experience any side effect from this medication.  Occaisionaly I may feel a little drowsy or relaxed but it is very mild and even welcome at times.	I take this medication at the onset of a migraine or severe headache.  It works 99% of the time.  Rarely I have to take a second dose (as instructed) if the headache does not subside but this is very rare.  It was prescribed for menstrual migraine but works for other causes of headache as well.

3765	spironolactone	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Acne decreased significantly when used in combination with the antibiotic erythromycin. The addition of spironolactone cleared up the acne that seemed to be triggered by fluctuating hormone levels. It also increased breast size.	With the increase of breast size also came extreme breast tenderness, especially during the week before menstrual flow.	Sprironolactone taken once a day in combination with antibiotic erythromycin to clear up acne that was triggered by hormones and antibiotic alone did not clear up.
2790	wellbutrin	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	The medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression.	Unfortunately, the drug seemed to correlate with an increased severity of a pre-existing condition: tinnitus. The tinnitus which was moderate to begin with became severe and ultimately led me to stop taking the medication. The tinnitus, though still present, is markedly less severe and decreased almost immediately after stopping the medication.	I was prescribed Wellbutrin, was on it for approximately 5 months and gradually stopped over the course of a few days.

1091	effexor	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The benefits of taking Effexor are wonderful. My mood has been so much better. I can function properly without feeling overwhelmed and or stressed out. I have recommended this drug to many of my friends who have had similar problems.	The side effects are mild, but excessive sweating is one of them. I seem to sweat a good bit more than I normally did as well as sweat more than other people that I notice. Also night sweats have been a problem from time to time. Constipation can also be a side effect.	The details in the treatment are just as I described shortly above. I went to the doctor, they prescribed it and I take it. Don't really know what else to say here for the treatment details.

403	restasis	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe dry eyes	After 6 weeks began to reduce the itchy swollen eyes.  Long distance vision gradually cleared and returned to near normal.  After an additional three weeks the itchiness is continuing to reduce and the distance vision is continuing to improve.  Eyes are still itchy but I have gone from putting over-the-counter eye drops in my eyes more than 10x during an eight hour period to about 2x during an eight hour period.  I have improved from barely being able to read the top line of the eye chart to almost normal vision.	Severe burning sensation in eyes about one minute after applying drops.  This burning sensation did not always occur.  When the burning sensation occurred my eyes were photosensitive so I had to remain in a dark room for about 15 minutes.  I wore dark glasses for about one hour after leaving the dark room.  I put the eye drops in my eyes in the morning and before going to bed at night.  This meant some mornings I would be leaving for work at 6am (quite dark out) with dark glasses on as any amount of light was painful.	1-2 eye drops twice a day
198	adderall	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	Increased concentration and attention span, reduced appetite. Material studied remained more solidly in short-term memory.	Mild addiction and nausea when treatment period ended. Material studied tended to dissipate in longer-term memory. After treatment period appetite returned with a vengence,resulting in overeating.	Since I control when I take the meds (what time, how much- up to 3 per day) I think I have over-done it on occasion, even though it was never above what I'm perscribed.  Some days I will take 3 pills so I can truly concentrate, and then can't sleep. . . may have to take a sleeping pill. . . wake up feeling awful and groggy. . . and have to do the whole viscious cycle all over again.  So, even though I'm doing what I'm perscribed to do, it can be too much for me.  I can understand why there is abuse potential with this drug, as you start feeling dependent on it.  Even with all that, the drug has helped me out more than I can ever explain.
2482	enbrel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	psoriasis	After having a severe outbreak of psoriasis Enbrel was the only one that cleared it up in about a month. been on medication almost three years and still have some psoriasis flare ups but not as bad as it was before. Maybe caused more due to stress. Also joint swelling and pain in my legs have gone away still feel fatigued sometimes but common with the disease.	Some bruising to the site of injections but doctors monitor it every three months and blood work comes back normal to good.	Enbrel weekly - self injected subcutaneously, 50mg
2146	zyrtec	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe allergies	When I started taking Zyrtec I had severe sore throat pain that I thought might be strep throat.  It turned out to be environmental allergies.  While I was taking Claritin for about a year, it wasn;t having any effect on these allergies.	When I first started taking it, I would get drowsy.  I started splitting the pill in half and taking them about 12 hours apart and this seemed to help.  Also I noticed a drastic decrease in alcohol tolerance.	I took a half of a 10 mg Zyrtec tablet 2X a day for about 2 months.  I do not have health insurance and could not get a refill.
2520	motrin	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	severe headache	Ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did.	There did not seem to be any side effects of the ibuprofen. I almost always tried to make sure and eat something or drink milk when taking the medication as indicated to take with food.  I didn't experience any problems even when taking the maximum dosage suggested, 3 within a 24 hour period.	"Depending on my arthritis pain, I would take 1 x 600mg Ibuprofen two to three times per day. During flare-ups, it was necessary to ""hit the pain hard"" and take 600 mg four times per day and on the very rare occasion 5 times per day (this has not been necessary for over 10 yrs.)"

I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL MOUTH NOW AND EVEN MY GUM DISEASE IS IMPROVING,	major rash over most of my body (75%), took 2 weeks to go away.  Low grade fever (100.) for the first few days after rash appeared.	"""Hi. I started taking clindamycin about an hour ago for a bacterial infection (upper respiratory / sinus infection). Within only several minutes my esophagus started burning and I feel like throwing up. I have only had one dose of 300mg. I was started on clindamycin because I had bad side effects (numbness and tingling in my hands) to another antibiotic (clarithromycin). Clarithromycin really helped treat the infection, but I stopped it after 3 days. I&#039;m allergic to penicillin so that makes things harder. My doctor warned me about the harshness of clindamycin, but I thought that I&#039;d rather have some GI issues than neuropathy as a side effect - which is still true, but I can&#039;t imagine taking even another dose as I feel so sick."""
255	ultram	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post cosmetic surgery complications	The pain from the muscle spasms was drastically reduced.	"A little ""high"" feeling.  Kind of warm and fuzzy.  Very relaxed."	Tramadol was prescribed after suffering from TMJ for over 20 years. I suffered from chronic pain due to severe TMJ complications.  In addition, the TMJ was causing migraine headaches and insomnia.  After all conventional methods of treatment (e.g., exercises, mouth appliances etc.) and drugs (e.g, ibuprofen) did not alleviate the problem, symptoms or pain, the only option left was surgery.  Because surgery for TMJ conditions is not a guarantee for success, I was reluctant to agree to the procedure.  Finally, as a last resort, I met with a doctor who specialized in chronic pain management and I was prescribed Tramadol, 100 mg/twice daily.  This drug has worked extremely well for the past 11 years in controlling the pain.

My boyfriend couldn't get his member inside of me, and when he finally did it gave him severe gouges on his shaft.  It caused me to stop eating, and when I did I just threw it up... It caused me to become violent, I even struck my boyfriend a few times during an argument.  I was on my period the entire week, the bleeding just wouldn't stop.  It was horrible.  Not to mention, the pain I felt inside of my vagina was tremendous.  I could hardly sit down by the end of the week.  I do not recommend that anyone believes this.	I used five rings daily, before every intimate encounter.  Ouch!

527	requip	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	If I take requip several hours before sleep it keeps my legs calm for the most part.  Requip seemed like a miracle the first few years then it seems it didn't work as well.  I told my doctor about it and he suggested I take two requip a night instead of one, that also helped for a while.  Im greatful for the medicine although its not a miracle it does help a great deal.	The only side effect I have is IF i skip a night it seems that my problem is much worse.	I try to go to bed the same time every night and I take my requip.
2231	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Allegra minimized the allergy symptoms without the side effect of drowsiness that is typical of over-the-counter allergy medications such as Benadryll.  After taking the drug, congestion is greatly reduced and the constant sneezing stops.  However, Allegra is not very effective for itchy, dry eyes, which continues to be a problem during peak allergy season.	No side effects have been observed during the 10 years of use.  Drowsiness has not been an issue and no reactions to other medications have been experienced.	One tablet is taken per day whenever allergy symptoms are moderate to severe.  No medication is taken on days when allergies are mild.
4118	chantix	4	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	smoking cessation	Chantix was incredibly effective for the purpose of smoking cessation. While users are advised that initiative must be taken on their part to successfully quit smoking, I felt that the drug decreased the desire for nicotine so effectively, making smoking absolutely repellent, that a patient taking the drug would most likely quit without much active effort.	Vivid dreams, often lasting throughout the night, not necessarily disturbing, as some have reported, but (seemingly) long, deep, and realistic. Perhaps for this reason, I did not awake feeling well-rested while taking the drug. Significant loss of appetite occurred, but sugary foods seemed more appealing. Mood became depressed to the point that suicidal thoughts occurred.	"Began taking a low-dose as part of the ""starter pack."" Desire to smoke diminished quickly and was gone within only a few days. Dose gradually increased to 2 1.0mg tablets/day. Continued with this dosage for close to two months at which time I stopped taking the drug due to the side effects listed above. Have since started smoking again."
3533	lunesta	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	severe insomnia	The benefits were simple--NONE	I can't really comment on the side effects of this sleep-aid. I haven't had the pleasure of yawning.	I read carefully over the booklet and the website, thinking that maybe i was doing something wrong. I took the lunesta along the zanaflex hoping for a better result and, none!! Took it at 11pm and 3:44am, im still going strong-not even a yawn! I was formally on ambian, which would take over an hour to kick in, but my sleep time was averaging about two hours.
1299	zocor	3	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	high cholesterol	I was originally prescribed 20 mg, but the rating was creeping up again, so the dosage was doubled. As I only took it for 2 weeks, cannot be sure of effectiveness	About 2 days after starting the course I began to get muscle pains. I had had these pains before (months ago) but the drug seemed to amplify them. The sites were a) in the groin area b) in the heel area, probably the achilles tendon	I told the doctor of the problems, and he immediately changed me over to atorvastatin, 20mg, and the pains have disappeared.

I lost weight because most of the time I was no longer depresses. and My overall health improved	For the first 6 months profuse se sweating and insomia.	"I've been on Effexor for about 7 years, and love it. It doesn't make you sleepy or passive. It doesn't kill your sex drive, though it is reduced a bit, and it's still harder to reach orgasm. Best part about this med is that it doesn't make you sleepy or foggy. 

You may have to increase dosage after a couple of years. It started to poop out on me at about year 3, and since then I've been climbing with the dosage. 

I've tried many anti-depressants, and this is the gold standard for me. Paxil robbed me of many years...no ambition, no focus, very sloppy housekeeping. Effexor is much better."
3713	lamictal	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar ii	My head felt very clear for the first time in years. I didn't get rattled as easily. Mood stabilizer is a very good description of it. I was able to get motivated, and not feel the world was ending every time something went wrong. I lost the desire to spend money in a ridiculous fashion.	Unfortunately I developed the much feared rash, and had to discontinue. I had recently started Cymbalta, so I can't be sure it was the Lamictal that set me off, but the psychiatrist didn't want to risk it. I did have to change the timing of the dose to bedtime, as it made me a bit tired shortly after I took it. Also, I believe it affected my vision, which got a bit blurry sometimes.	I spent years shuttling between SSRI's, which I know know were the key element in tipping me into mania several times. After the psychiatrist determined the problem was BiPolar 2, the first treatment she considered was Lamictal. I did get some headaches at first, and unfortunately, at some point the effects were negated by the addition of Adderal. Once the Adderal was stopped, it was all good again. I would recommend this drug to anyone, with the proviso that if the SJS rash shows up, you must stop it immediately. Despite that, I really feel it is worth trying.
668	erythromycin	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	I was able to get rid of an infection that had been bothering for awhile.	I developed a rash across my stomach within 45 min. of the first dose and began itching.	"""I&#039;m taking this due to ear and sinus infection and swollen lymph nodes. I&#039;m allergic to penicillin, so doctor gave me these. Seems to be working on infection, but slowly. I have to take 500mg 2xs a day. It gives me terrible stomach cramps and pain, but after I eat, the pain goes away. I&#039;m just very lazy, tired and my brain is cloudy. Don&#039;t feel myself. Not sure if its due to my illness or the medicine. Drinks a lot of water. Hope you feel better!"""
1697	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sun damage to face	"The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience."	"Some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when I started writing a response to the first question, I didn't see what was to follow.  The Retin-A gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  For this reason, I used it every other day instead of every day. I alternate with Stri-Vectin.  I also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!
When exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  I have used Benefit Cosmetics' ""Bluff Puff"" to tone down the redness; I have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  However, my complexion looks great without makeup.  I still use mascara and liner and shadow."	"Before going to bed, I wash my face with the Clarisonic brush.  I love it!
When my face is clean and dry, I apply a pea-sized amount of Retin-A gel all over my face and neck.  I do not avoid the eye area, but I do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  I also put Talika Lipocils on my eyelashes.  
In the morning I wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  Then I moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  This does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  
The following night I wash my face and when it is clean and dry, I apply Stri-Vectin.  I alternate so that one night I use Retin-A and the next night I use Stri-Vectin or another moisturizer.  I don't think I will be buying any more Stri-Vectin because I am doubtful of its effectiveness and because I would prefer to make my own product.  I know that I will be unable to make Retin-A gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me."
3182	desyrel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomia	"I can not shut my mind down to go to sleep.  I will lay there and think of thing after thing and cannot ""shut down."" I originally took ambien for insomia, but my insurance would not fully cover the prescription and it was too expensive to take nightly.  My doctor put me on trazadone as a safe, low cost alternative.  I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a trazadone each night. I vary the dosage, depending on how ""excitable"" I feel that day. It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it, if I stay up watching tv or reading, when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  I had to go back to bed!  I love the drug and since I tend to be high strung anyway, I am sure that I am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone."	"I have had none of the side effects listed except for the ""may cause drowziness"" which is the whole reason I am taking trazadone."	"Before taking this medication I was in constant pain. Every muscle in my body hurt. Legs, Back, arms. All my joints felt like they were being nawed away and had burning pain in ever muscle. I had a Migraine ever minute of every day. I was constantly exsausted. After taking it for one week, I felt like a new person. For me this was a miracle drug. I stopped taking it after a month and was pain free.  
Since then, When ever my Fibromyalgia flares up... I take it for a week or more and it puts me back on a deep sleep pattern. I don't have to take it all the time. Just when I need it."
451	lorazepam	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	alcohol abuse	"Eliminated physical craving for alcohol. Relaxing. Reduced anxiety. Lowered blood presssure and heart rate.
I had been unable to taper off or quit drinking alcohol for over 3 years, and drinking was affecting my work and home life. I was frightened of the severe anxiety when I would try to stop drinking.

1 tablet every 8 hours/day for 3 days.

3953	prilosec	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nausea after eating	I was able to eat without nausea and vomiting after meals.  I was able to regain lost weight.  I was able to eat normal sized meals again.	I had no side effect with the treatment.  The only drawback was the need to eat within 30 minutes of taking the medication.  There were times when an unavoidable delay in the mealtime made it necessary to eat something else in the interim.	I didn't have usual GERD symptoms of heart burn.  I was skeptical that my stomach was producing too much acid.  I tried other home remedies like drinking diluted apple cider after a meal that seemed to work at times but didn't always.  After my doctor prescribed prilosec, it took several weeks before relief was complete.  I am still taking the medication but have scaled back to 20 mg just once a day.
2594	buspar	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	It did help to relieve my anxiety, but sometimes I had to take a full tablet rather than 1/2. It did enable me to ably cope with occasions where I otherwise would have been nervous wreck.  I can honestly say that it helped me.	I didn't have any.	I only took it sporadically whenever needed. I only used it when I needed calming down when I was in a situation that I wouldn't have have been able to cope with.
659	seasonique	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	I assume this birth control prevented pregnancy effectively. My boyfriend and I used it as a back up.	I've been on seasonique for three months now and they've been absolutely miserable. For starters, I'm 19 and NEVER have break outs. As soon as I started this pill, I began breaking out every few days. This pill has made me gain about ten pounds. I've been spotting for a month and a half. I have horrible cramps everyday. I'm EXTREMELY moody and emotional. I cry about absolutely nothing at all and snap at the smallest things. I get crazy hot flashes, I'll be freezing one minute and sweating the next. My back also hurts at times.	switched pills
3951	prilosec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gastritis	Eliminated pressure in my upper abdomen and reduced reflux. I have a hiatal hernia so it also helped with acid reflux.	None, but I am concerned about calcium absorption since I have Osteopenia.  I was supplementing with B12.	Dose was once a day.  I've been off it for two months and have some mild symptoms of gastritis.
3730	lamictal	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	epilepsy	Almost completely Stopped seizures	Dizziness (feeling like walking on a dock), Anxiety attacks, some decreased mental sharpness, memory loss	Started taking 75mg twice a day, never got another grand mal seizure but still got auras about 3-4 a month.  Experienced anxiety attacks in the first 2 weeks but then they went away.   Increased dose to 100mg twice a day, auras decreased to 1-2 per month all was well for about 6 years. Began to notice dizziness while walking or looking down, but nothing debilitating.  After 6 years, anxiety attacks sharply increased along with dizziness.  Started taking Xanax XR to control anxiety attacks and dizziness.  Auras decreased to 1 every 3 months.  However, dizziness, slight disorientation and anxiety when Xanax starts to wear off.  Xanax has helped maintain consistent sleep pattern.

1937	lac-hydrin	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	extremely dry skin	It was helpful in reducing the severity on my life-long extremely dry, flaky, itchy skin. It was recommended that I be certain to apply it directly after a shower, when the skin still retains some of it's moisture from the shower itself. This is true for all lotions, but seemed particularly helpful with the Lac-hydrin. Unfortunately, though it was more helpful than many lotions I've used, the benefits did not warrant the higher price of the product. Ultimately, I've found BETTER results with the much cheaper Eucerin and even Curel moisturizing lines.	During the 6 months during which I used the Lac-hydrin, I didn't experience any negative side-effects. I was using it during winter months, so I don't have any feedback to offer on sun-sensitivity. I didn't experience any additional skin irritation that lessened my interest in the product. I simply moved on to other products because of the price.	The Lac-hydrin was applied topically to all parts of my body (expect my face) twice daily. My dermatologist recommended that one of the applications be directly after my shower. The skin will retain moisture from the shower for a bit, and the application of the Lac-hydrin will help to keep it there. I would reapply to dry skin again before bed.
1466	cymbalta	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The benefits are less depression and better mood. It took about two weeks until I started to feel better but now I feel I may need something a bit stronger as I feel I am too used to taking this medication. I plan to ask for a higher dosage or different medication.	Really none.	I don't really know what the details would be except that I started with 20mg and was increased to 30mg within two weeks.

This product really does work	"Not sure if this is related, but I had a pain in my testicle for about 3 weeks straight.  Doctor ruled out hernia and UA came back negative for infections.
I had a small decrease in libido, but it was nothing too serious.  If you like having sex 5 times a day, then this might not be for you.  But, you will still have a normal libido.  Also maybe some fatigue, but again could be related to something else.(stress)"	overall,this is great if you can't stand rogaine.
25	alprazolam	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, panic attck, nervousness	I experienced Xannax more effective for anxiety and panic attacks.	"I didn't feel any alarming side effects from this medication even after using for  over 8 years. 
The feeling of dependency doesn't bother as we are sometimes addict of certain foods also."	"First I experienced the state of anxiety and panic at the age of 20. Starting with Librium I was successful to managed and control my mood and over sensitive nature.
Regular exercise, food and lively hobbies helped to relieve me form all sedative and tranquilizers.
It was, probably, job related stress and tension what triggered the state of anxiety and panic.

It also appeared to enhance the recovery rate from this prolonged infection.	"The patient was extreemly hungry on this medication and some weight gain was observed.  In this case, this was a positive side-effect as the patient was very underweight.

No other side-effects were noted however the treatment regime was difficlut for an elderly person to understand and needed the support of a family member to ensure that doses were not missed."	"40mg (8 tables of 5mg) taken for 5 days then 7 tablets taken for 3 days, 6 for 3 days, 5 for three days until taking one talbe for three days then stopping.

The importance of not missing or suddenly stopping this treatment was stressed by our doctor, as I beleive this can cause serious side-effects."

This medication stopped the sneezing for about 4 hrs.  Then it resumed as did the continuous runny nose.
Directions say take 1 only every 24 hrs.  I won't buy this medication again.    No noticeable side effects at all except it certainly didn't work at all."
505	paxil-cr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	obsessive compulsive disorder	It allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that I could not ignore before. Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore.	Getting on the drug was tough, because I endured insomnia, sweating, loss of appetite, high-anxiety, shaking, hands, and restlessness.  After about 2-3 weeks, however, all those symptoms went away, once my body got used to it.  I did have some weight gain, but I was really skinny to begin with.	I've dealt with anxiety since I was a kid as well as obsessive thinking.  It continued to build until I was 17 and I had a major panic attack, which I could not calm down from.  My psychiatrist put me on Paxil CR and I worked up to 25 mg.  The dosage made a big difference, though I still had moderate levels of anxiety, but I could function.  About a year and a half ago I was hit with another major attack that send me into a relapse for about 2-3 months, then I upped my dosage to 37.5 mg and within a week I felt fine, even better than I felt before.  Now a year and a half later, I found myself in another relapse and after a week I released that all this time I was not at a high enough dosage because my anxiety and obsessive thoughts would still creep in and cause me distress.  So my psychiatrist agreed that I was not at my ideal dosage and I am now taking two 25 mg in the morning which equals 50 mg, which is still a fairly moderate dosage considering other patients that were on 80 to even 120 mg.  I just started taking it, so I should start feeling even better within about a week or two.  I've accepted that I may need to be on this for the long haul, which is fine.  I look at is as nutrition for the brain, or like taking insulin for diabetes, it allows me function and enjoy life.
2904	tramadol	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	pain relief (glenohumeral instability correction)	Virtually no pain.	Mental numbness, feebleness, lethargy, depression, cognitive dysfunction.	Due to the above mentioned side effects, I stopped with the Tramadol after just two days and opted for  pain and paracetamol.
2299	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	This drug was most effective in 'cooling' my anxiety.  The depression was less affected, but definately improved.  I felt much calmer and able to deal with my situation more effectively.  I wasn't panic striken anymore or weeping all the time.	At first the dose of 20mg left me a little zombie like.  I'd sit and stare out the window all day.  When the dose was reduced to 10mg. this side effect went away.  I also developed a clenched jaw, which sometimes I snapped and my teeth grinding became much worse.  I also developed ringing in my ears.  I also gained weight, a total of 25 pounds.	I was treated for anxiety and depression with this drug, beginning with 20mg and then reducing it to 10mg.  I was going through a divorse at the time and could not cope with the overwhelming crisis.  This drug was given in combination with cognitive psychotherapy and together I believe they were very effective.  I was able to be weaned off very easily after one and a half years and feel fine now.  The side affects were a bit troublesome and they remain; ie.  the teeth grinding and ringing in the ears and weight gain.
967	sarafem	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	This drug improved my mood greatly. I can take more stress at work, in my romantic life, and family situations where as before, I would crawl under a rock and cry. A lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug, but I think it was low enough to where I could have moderate lows and elevated highs. It helped me control my impulsive behavior with eating.	I had headaches if I didn't take it with enough food in my stomach. I also have insomnia, however, if you cut your intake of caffeine, it shouldn't be too severe.	I took this at noon. It's a strange feeling on this drug because later in the day, I feel a bit strange. Either way, I know what people mean when they say that they feel a lot of indifference come over them at times they should be feeling overwhelming emotions. This drug helps me cope and sometimes I feel like I don't need it anymore, but I go right back on it when I feel the blues creeping up on me again.

Will NEVER take it again!"	"I went to urgent care because i was having severe kidney pain and i found blood in my urine.  The dr. too found blood and protien and suggested this drug.   I mentioned that i rarely take even and aspirin and am prone to side effects.  I also mentioned that a week earlier i had bloodwork done and it showed an inflamed liver.  I waited for the office to call me with the results which they never did.  Finally i called and they said they had lost my number, but yes indeed i did have a UTI.  (8 days later). I mentioned that i was having severe side effects and before i said what they were, they said, ""It doesn't sound related to the drug"".  It was an apprubt brush off.  Will these sypmtoms ever go away?  What is the time frame?"
1573	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Xanax took the edge off of the anxiety without causing drowsiness or interfering with thought process. The anxiety was due to court testimony and memory recall of 5 years prior. Calendar dates were going to be of importance.	There were none whatsoever except the anxiety returned when the drug wore off and when I was anxious my memory recall was negatively affected.	Take Xanax an hour before an anxiety inducing situation, or at night to reduce panic/anxiety attacks until the Lexpro kicked in (about a month). After taking Lexpro for several weeks, the Xanax was no longer necessary.

320	ativan	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	sleep problem	At first, could actually sleep. The sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  As stress increased, nothing helped,not even the Ativan.	"Loss of energy.  Huge increase in anger and irritability over seemingly non-issues.  Personality changes to being more depressed and pessimistic.  World view was negative, and everyone was an 'asshole'.  Did not want to do anything or try anything or go out.  Not even things normally that were turn ons ie. movies, dancing, sex, food
After 6-8months on the drug, it helped not at all and sleep was down to 1-2 hours per nite."	"""I received a shot last week of this at the hospital. It was great at first and was working great for my severe panic attacks, then about 45 minutes later, I started seeing Mickey mouse bumper boats and pink pigs standing in cake. The hospital didn&#039;t do anything for me and this is considered a severe side effect. They sent me home and then I slept for 36 hours and had a Migraine for 2 days after. I image it works for others but not me, way to many side effects, when I have 2 kids I have to take care of."""
911	paxil	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression, social anxiety disorder	For the first two weeks I did not feel absolutely anything. Then, after about 15 days, I began to feel different. My constant sense of fear and worry was replaced by a sudden feeling of self-confidence. My depression, which formerly kept me in a state of perpetual sorrow, self-pity and doubt, was lifted from me like a veil. Suddenly I was talkative and social, where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do. I was asking women on dates with a directness and boldness that almost scared women away. You could say that while I was taking Paxil I was in a hypermanic state. The benefits were very real. I loved the miraculous effects of this medication. Unfortunately I was forced to stop taking Paxil because of negative side effects.	Decreased libido, insomnia, dry mouth, increased appetite	"I was not able to have sex because Paxil left me sexually numb. It was difficult to maintain an erection. When I did get an erection it was without any sexual pleasure, in other words, it was just a mechanical erection.
I could not sleep no matter how tired I became during the day. I had constant energy that would not go away even when I wanted to sleep. The insomnia was so bad that even sleeping pills could not counteract Paxil.
Dry mouth was mild to moderate, but nonetheless bothersome.
I gained a tremendous amount of weight in a short time. I went from 171lbs. to 227lbs. in about 4 months. Paxil gave me a huge appetite. I simply could not stop thinking about food, particularly sweets."
932	levaquin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection	I had a terrible sinus infection with bloodly and puss-y? volumous nasal discharge once every 5 minutes.  Couldn't sleep much.	stomach slightly upset	The first 5 pack dose was taken, on the 3rd day, discharge dramatically slowed down.  After the 5th day, the symptoms had almost cleared, but not completely. Being able to breathe through both nostrils was fantastic. This drug was very expensive ($125/ pack).  After the 9th day I decided to get a refill, as the discharge was returning. After completion of the second pack, symptoms cleared up. Would have been better to have a 6 pack, and I think I waited too long to purchase the second pack.  I didn't like the fact that the infection started to rebuild.
2319	lexapro	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression and generalized anxiety	I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact, the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However, this was the only benefit I experienced.	"I gained 15 pounds, which my doctor swears was not related to the medication.  BUT - I have always struggled to GAIN weight - I weighed 95 pounds in college and finally got up to a healthy 115 with a lot of hard work.  In just the two months of being on Lexapro, I went up to 130.  Not being able to fit into any of my clothes during summer is NOT helping my depression.

Immediately upon beginning to take Lexapro, I felt ""high"" for about two weeks.  My doctor says ""that shouldn't happen because of the medication.""  Well, I wasn't doing any other drugs, so I don't know what to tell you there.

Possibly the worst side effect I experienced was a DECREASE in motivation.  If you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons I sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  I had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  Well, within two weeks of starting this medication, I began needing long naps (3+ hours) every day just to function.  I watched TV for the rest of the day.  I had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  It was a severe decrease in motivation.

Also, I had no sex drive and was unable to orgasm."	"I missed an appointment with my doctor and was not able to get a refill, so I have been off the Lexapro for a week.  In that time, I no longer needed to take naps and although I still procrastinate, it's back to the ""pre-Lexapro"" levels of procrastination, not the terrible levels I experienced while on the drug.  My temper did come back, though.  The withdrawals caused me to be so nauseous that I began throwing up and have had migraines ever since I stopped taking it.  (Again, my doctor said ""This medication shouldn't do that. Maybe you have the flu."")  Last night, though, I had great sex with my husband and was able to orgasm easily.  

Needless to say, at my doctor's appointment today I asked to be switched and will begin Wellbutrin right away.  (Oh, and I fired that doctor.)"
2215	benicar-hct	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressue --  diuretic	My blood pressure levels were controlled quite well.  However,  they spike from time to time,  not dropping until I take another dose.	There were no side effects that I am aware of.	"The medication was prescribed to control symptoms of high blood pressure and water
retention that I was experiencing.  

I was also advised to adhere to a low-sodium diet and to exercise moderately.  This and taking the medication faithfully has served well to decrease  high blood 
pressure symptoms.  However,  water retention has not significantly reduced."

2328	lexapro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"I'm  taking better care of myself and my appearance. I'm interacting with people and don't feel so detached from others. I'm starting to look forward to things again after feeling numb for so long.
Minimal side effects and only lasted a few days. I couldn't tolerate any other anti-D's that I tried because of side effects."	"Minimal but after 3 days I felt nauseas, queezy, fatigued and a bit 'out of it' and numb/detached.
The nausea only lasted a week but the fatigue hung around for a while. Now it's lifting thankfully.
No weight changes at all."	"I was skeptical that depression even existed so delayed my psych's advice in taking it for a year.
 Got to the point I felt so bad I admitted I had a problem and began a small dose of 1/4 tablet once a day. 
That's all I need for now too. I feel completely different from how I did 3 months ago - I have a personality again! The low days aren't so low and don't paralyze me anymore.
My appetite is normal again after having none for months. The only weight I put on is what I lost and that's because I'm feeling better and have my appetite back. Still underweight but I'm on the way to being healthy again.
I feel more alive and positive. I don't feel so withdrawn, guilty and ashamed for no reason. It's not a miracle pill and you have to do the work to get there but Lexapro is helping me to 'get there'. I'll take it for as long as I need to. Find a good Dr and PLEASE listen to them and take it if you need to. Don't live in misery because of the stigma society sometimes puts on mental health issues. Screw society and put your mental health first!"

607	minocin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	cystic acne	My cystic acne was reduced. My face did clear up consistently with the help of the pills and creams such as retin-a.	I needed to take the pills with lots of water, so I was always taking trips to the bathroom. I was on this pill for a long time, and I dont know if the constant ringing of my ears was a side effect, I did visit an ear doctor for this problem I thought was tinnitus but the doctor assured me the minocin had nothing to do with it. The ringing of the ears continued for about a year after I stopped taking minocycline. Occasionally I still get a ringing of the years, it can be sudden but lasts for a second or so...I was never diagnosed with tinnutus, but the ringing did lessen until it left after i stopped the pills.	I was to take the pills twice a day with water. I took one in the morning after I ate, and one at night with plenty of water....after a year my body became resistant to the pill and stopped working, and i started taking higher doses without my doctors consent..which was wrong of me and dangerous and maybe that is why the ringing of my ears began...but I was obssessed with clearing up my acne.

I took one tablet on the same day each week with plenty of water first thing in the morning and stood upright for the next two hours as I prepared for work. The side effects were numerous and severe, and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that I feared I may not survive the year. My physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that I continue taking the drug. I began intense research on my own and discovered I was not alone, and would have to make every attempt to save myself.	The side effects began with nausea and stomach pains mirroring acid reflux which even Nexium could not relieve.

I was like a week to eliminate it from my body and have to take another prescription for the rash, an anthistaminic or antialergic.	Just take the pills every 8 hours to tame the pain because of the root canal procedure that was done partially, not totally because of the inflamatory process.

May have contributed to my insomnia.	Before I started taking Effexor I had tried Lexapro and Cymbalta with unsatisfactory results.  Having weaned off those, it was hard just to get out of bed - I was missing work and couldn't hold it together at all.  Within a couple of days of taking this I started to feel better.  It's been the best so far at managing my depression but I still needed other drugs to help with mood swings and anxiety.  Overall a good payoff, just wish it was generic!
3427	tazorac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	This product reduced the severity of the breakouts and reduced length of time of the acne outbreak.

The next day after taking valtrex as prescribed, redness of the area affected on my face did develop and a blister did appear to be forming, but the affected area had ceased to itch. 
By the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.
On the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.
By the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as I had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a 10 to 12 day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters. 
This medication made a real and positive difference for me in the development, disconfort and duration of the symptoms of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak."	No negative side effects were experienced.	Take two tablets by mouth with water twice daily for one day.

I was uncomfortable, however i have been 1 1/2 year without it and i barely get a little zit anymore.	pain, extreme dryness- esp my lips, very dry eyes. There is a great deal of monitoring with this drug... so you really have to be committed to using it (i.e., blood work, frequent dermatology visits, one month waiting period for women to be sure you get on oral birth control, monthly phone questionnaire with the company).	I began the medication at a dose of 30 mg once daily and it was increased to 60 mg... which became the maximum i could handle without significant discomfort.

2801	wellbutrin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"I have taken antidepressants for many years, and this is first that did not ""flip the switch"" on sexuality.  I no longer feel like I am looking out of a dark room.  I have more energy, feel more motivated, and overall function at a higher level than before."	"A little bit of ""hyper"" feelings.  I take the entire dose at one time, daily, and have been advised that the feeling of being revved up would disspiate if I did take it in two or more doses during the day.  I try to minimize the effect by taking the medication first thing in the morning."	I suffer chronic depression and the Wellbutrin is the first antidepressant that did not sedate me, and the only that did not dampen sexual feelings.  I have taken tricyclics (sp?) which were extremely sedating as well as limiting as far as OTC medications and dietary restrictions.  I have also tried SSRIs (prozac, zoloft, etc.)and while they temporarily relieved my depression, 1) the effect did not last more than 6 months, and 2) they completely destroyed my libido.
1021	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	adhd	Sustained focus, improvement in attention span and greater achievement of daily tasks.  Easy to take, just one pill a day!	I had no side effects with this drug!  I loved it.	Vyvanse is a new medication used to treat ADHD.  It is a time-released capsule.  It is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills), and does not upset your stomach.  I took one 70mg pill in the morning.  The pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. I did NOT have any of the normal ADHD med. side effects, such as: rapid heart rate, anxiety, jittery feeling.  The only downside to this medication is the cost.  Since Vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.  I paid $160/month for 30 pills! I was self-pay though, so I'm sure having insurance would be ideal! Although it is very expensive, it is well worth it.
2733	elavil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/insomnia	"This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime ""hangover"" effect and the dose can be increased easily."	The major side effect of drowsiness is desirable in my case, but it also has a marked side effect of weight gain.  In addition, there is a dry mouth effect that seems to resolve after a month or two.	This was prescribed by my psychiatrist after trying several newer hypnotics.  The newer medications such as Ambien and Lunestra caused sleep disturbances, particularly altered dreams states.  In the case of the latter, it is prohibitively expensive.

I did not need other over the counter remedies I had used in the past, such as anti-gas and antacid medications taken after symptoms appeared.	Unfortunately, I became woozy and suffered dizziness after taking the medication, often requiring that I lie down and or take a nap. After an initial period of a few hours, these symptoms subsided. Side effects were sporadic and I tried initially to continue the medication due to its effectiveness.	"""I used Prevacid for 8 weeks for a new symptomatic phase of GERD.

My Dermatologist prescribed Tri-Luma cream to lighten the spots and also said it would help redice the appearance of my wrinkles. I used the cream each night. The texture was thick and the smell was not appealing. A few days after use my skin started peeling where I had been using the cream. The peeling was annoying as I would constantly have to put moisturizer on to stick the skin back down. After a month of dilligent nightly usage I did not notice a lightening of my dark spots nor any reduction in my wrinkles.  Perhaps with continued use my spots would have lightened but honestly, I couldn't stand walking around with skin peels hanging off my face. The Dr should have advised me about the peeling. I was very dissappointed as this prescription cream cost $100.

By the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. I'm cyst free since then.	It stopped my menstrual cycle but after three months, my period came as usual so it's not a big problem. But the worst side effect for me was I got acne which was severe and left pitted scars. Not only that, I noticed my skin (whole body and face) after the acne stopped was very very dry and aged very fast. It took long time for my skin to become somewhat normal again. Hairs on my legs were getting longer and more prominent too. And another side effect was weight gain with enormous appetite which you could feel was not normal appetite. I gained about 8kg and then lost it which result in sagging skin on my face.	The treatment was easy enough. The gynaecologist prescribed Danazol for the ovarian cyst I had and it was very effective. The cyst was gone and didn't come back too.
3292	zoloft	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	head injuries	Due to a car accident I sustained head injuries in addition to physical body injuries (broken bones, etc.)  I had terrible mood swings.

My short term memory returned and I became less self conscious.	Sometimes I experienced a slight ticking in my head as if I had something in my brain clicking all the time.  If I do not take the Zoloft when I get up (later in the day) I get headachs.  No other side effects.	Initial dosage was 50 mg gradually over two year my span dosage increased to 200 mg.  I still am taking Zoloft.  I am somewhat fraid my symptoms will resurface.  I am also concerned about any withdrawals or headachs.
1997	vicodin	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain from broken arm	"It took the ""edge"" off the pain, for sure.  Without the medication I don't know how I could have put up with it."	I was so out of it from the one pill, mouth hanging open, drooling, to take I had to cut it in half.  I also experienced digestive distress, and overall yucky feeling, not some blissfully pain free state. My arm was shattered..the bone was separated about 1/2 an inch at the upper arm, and a crack ran down a few inches to another break.  It was excruciating, but the 1/2 pill was enough to dull the pain to the point where I could sleep, and make it up to go to the restroom.	"The Vicodin was for the pain of the broken arm.  The arm was in a plastic type of cast and sling.  After 8 weeks I was able to remove the sling but the shoulder had ""frozen"" by then so the physio required was just as painful!"
3576	differin	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Differin does help reduce the number of pimples for an acne patient.  It did not eliminate them in my case, but reduced them by about 50%.	Dryness and flakiness were the two most common side effects that I experienced. In addition, my skin became more sensitive to environmental stresses like wind, cold, and sun.  Consequently my face often appeared flush.	My dermatologist prescribed this with a water pill and some kind of anti-bacteria medicine to treat my acne.  I have been on Yaz for a year and it has not helped my acne at all. All over the counter medicines have been ineffective.  I mostly break out around my period and I only get pimples where I have hair folicles.

I did have concerns about taking an oral steroid,but was reassured that the short duration would not cause adverse side effects.	After a first round of antibiotics and use of arbuterol with a nebulizer with minimal effectiveness, my doctor put me on an oral steroid to open up my airways. Once I started the seroid, I felt 100% better.
